<entry name="BB_FIXER_ACT3_MEET">Ah, miss! Course you’d be one to survive through all this! Capable as you seem and all. <page>It’s a sad thing, but I can’t say most folk down here’ve fared so fortunate. And our once fine camp below ain’t no longer safe for any bug, all crushed and consumed by this black calamity.<hpage>Nowhere is safe, sir, but I am glad you few remain. Know I shall work to fix this, as best I’m able.<page>Calming our raging world? That’s a lofty goal, miss. I’m not thinkin’ any one bug’d be able to stop these happenings, but it’s heartenin’ knowing you’ve still got fire enough to feel different.<page>Rest here with us, long as you like. A little company’s about the best thing we few’re wishin’ for now.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_DELIVERY"><hpage>Sir, I bring supplies from the town of bells up above, to aid your camp and its residents.<page>Ah! Mighty thankful these folks’ll be. Most arrive here with nothin’ but their shell. Your delivery there’ll make things a little easier on ‘em.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_MEET_ALT">Mm. Mmm! Who is it? An intruder! Terrible! To interrupt a humble druid as they work!<hpage>I meant no intrusion, druid. The sound of your laughter drew me to investigate.<page>What? Laughter? No idea what you mean. Nonsense!</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_BASEMENT_REPEAT">May your travels bring you fortune, hunter. And may the Citadel come to fear your freedom in our land.</entry>
<entry name="BELLWAY_PILGRIM_MEET_2">Hrm? Oh, it’s you again. Please, no more talk of bells or travel. I’m trying to stay hidden.<hpage>I mean no intrusion, ma’am. Are you composing yourself here before you leave on your own journey?<page>Like all the others, my brothers and sisters who trudged off to die? No, I think I’ll linger here a little longer with my thoughts...</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_GOT_SILKSPEAR">Must be terrifying out there, beyond the settlement. Nothing but monsters and madness lurking in the darkness.<page>I’ve heard tales of a safe place, though. Just up above here, where the moss paints the stones green, there’s an old village. Bit of a holy place, apparently, well protected.<hpage>I’ve visited the settlement you speak of. It was built around a burial spire, corpse-home to an ancient Weaver.<hpage>It is hardly safe though. The terrain is treacherous, and predators prowl its commons. I advise you avoid that place.<page>Oh... I see. Of course. Nowhere is really free of danger, is it? That’s just the way for us pilgrims...</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_2">For though, as pilgrims, we aim our sights high and never waver from our path, the loss of a brother or sister still stops our trembling limbs in place.</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_REPEAT">Few are as foreign as you, hunter dear. Visit me when you care.<page>I’ll look forward to hearing how your steps might shake our world. Oho. Yes!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_COMPLETED_ACT3">Ohh, the world trembles! But we can hear it... beating steady... beating free...</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_REFUSE">Granter refuses! I understand. Granter is petty, evil. Misguided! When your mind clears, return here. Return here and grant my wish!</entry>
<entry name="BELLWAY_PILGRIM_MEET_1">Oh... you’ve come to hide down here too, then? ‘Tis a fearful world out there. If you can keep quiet, I don’t mind you joining me.<hpage>You’ve chosen a curious place to rest, ma’am. This pit of bells and the structure around it... they suggest a station for travel, though one long abandoned.<page>Aye. Rumours in the camp say these bells run throughout the lands, great veins of them, forged by our ancient kin.<page>And some even say bugs used to travel through them, in gilded carriages no less!<page>Surely such fanciful travel would be a sin for us pilgrims. We must walk and climb and crawl using only our own meagre claws... Only thus can we prove our devotion.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_Q1_UNACCEPTED">Did you take a look at the wishwall? You might’ve noticed I added a cheeky little wish of my own.<page>Fair’s fair, I did build the thing. Seems like the kingdom should be granting my wish before anyone else’s.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_DONT_GIVE">You keep the berries to yourself? All for you? Mmm. Promise breaker! Promise breaker!</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_NAME">Never shared my name with you, did I? Awfully remiss of me.<page>It’s Pilby. Been nice spending time with you, miss.<hpage>Likewise, sir. It’s been some time since I had such ample opportunity for friendly conversation.<hpage>My name is Hornet. It is good to be properly acquainted at last.<page>Hornet, eh? Strong name, that. It certainly suits you, miss. Heh heh...</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_INTRO">The Mossberries. Do you still hunt them, little you? My wish was granted, but clear now that more are needed! More!<page>Bring more Mossberries here. Mmm. Yes, we will trade. Precious rosaries for fresh berries!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_CANCOMPLETE"><hpage>As promised, druid, I have your berries. What is your need for such common fruits?<page>Common!? No. No... Special. Cherished. Only a druid knows it! The berries bright! For my wish. My wish so dear! </entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_NOSTOCK_RETURN">I’ll soon be making my way up to the great Citadel. As holy as I am with rosaries, I’m sure my path will not be an arduous one...</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_ACT3_DELIVERY_POST">Oh! And you can’t be leavin’ without some reward for your work. Take these beads for labour.<page>Rosaries ain’t provin’ much use to us lot anymore, but hopefully you in all your journeyin’ can still put ‘em to use.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_OFFER">You’re here, in here, so why did you send you? Hm? Did you hear my wish? Granter of wishes? You?<hpage>Granter of wishes?<page>Wishes, yes! My wish! I need fruits of the world, three little darlings. I need them, so I wish! Does the kingdom not send you, little you, to grant my desire?</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_BELLHART">Your travels have taken you far, haven’t they? While I’m yet to even start my journey. Shameful behaviour for a pilgrim, really, to tarry here so long.<hpage>I see no shame in it, sir. Your life is your own, and need not be squandered at the ghostly call of the Citadel. Journey out for your own sake, or not at all.<page>Heh... you truly aren’t a pilgrim, that’s for certain. That’s blasphemy, spoken with friendly intentions or not.<page>And yet... I don’t recoil from what you say. Perhaps I’m not much of a pilgrim either.</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_ROSARY_MAGNET_DESC">This stone’s a beauty, isn’t it? They say it’ll help you gather up rosaries on the road ahead. You’ll come back and share some with me, won’t you?</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_NAME_2">Ah, thank you for sharing, sister. For the honourable and steadfast Pilby, we will sing.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_COMPLETED">Mmm. You can hear it, yes? Listen close. Weak, but precious. A pulse, a beat! Faint... Our very own...</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_ROSARY_SET_DESC">Loose rosaries filling your pockets? I can string ‘em up safe, so you won’t go losing them. Might seem a simple art, but it takes some talent to keep ‘em properly secure. </entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_MEET_ALT">Hm? I recognise you. You’ve returned to the camp, then? Are you a pilgrim, or just a wanderer?<hpage>I am no pilgrim, sir, though I have travelled their paths.<page>Not a pilgrim? Well, it makes no difference, I suppose. We all must walk the roads, up and up, though most of us will fall long before we see the grand gates.<page>If you’re wise, you’ll stop here and rest a while before heading back out into that dangerous world...</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_ACCEPT_2">Mmm, the precious fruit! Yes, fragrant and round. So round! For you, you who finds berries, a nice reward of rosaries!</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_MEET">O-oh! Traveller! Destined for the Citadel, yes? Well, before you embark, won’t you stop and make trade with an old pilgrim?<hpage>I’d see your wares, madam, though I fear I may have nothing worthy to offer in return.<page>Oh, worry not! If you lack fine goods to trade, we can barter still. In this devout land, we deal in the currency of faith!<page>Rosaries! Those finely carved beads of prayer! If you will only share some with me, I will trade you something fair.</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_TOKEN_FAITH_DESC">Seems like just a key, but who knows what it’ll unlock? I reckon it’s come from the Citadel, so it must open the way to something holy!</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_TOOLMETAL_DESC">A rare find, this. Shinier than faith and harder than a Craggler’s hide. A skilled craftsbug could fashion something nice out of it, if they’ve got the knowledge.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_DELIVERY_POST">For comin’ all this way, take a few beads. You’ve well earned ‘em.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_INGREDIENT"><hpage>Druid, I require a pitcher of your Mossberry Stew to satiate a gourmand of the Citadel. Will you pass some to me?<page>Mmmm! A bug who’ll consume my berry brew? Strong they’d be to bear a taste so sharp!<page>Here is a flavour so ripe! Searing! Flavour of pleasure and pain! They too may see the visions if they taste it strong. The visions, could they see?<page>Grant the stew! For your bug, mmmm... to share the visions. Yes! We shall pass it!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_FINAL_2">Ahhh! Ahhh-ohhhh! The smell again! Stronger, stronger now! But still young yet! Listen to your sisters, little one, and grow! Oh, grow!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_FINAL_3">Oh... mmm. Do they hurt you also, the visions? The stink? Nasty, horrible fruits. The pain!<page>Enough berries. We need no more. For you though, my one and only friend. My beloved. A reward!<page>Your amulet. Let me... transfuse. Yes. Your amulet’s tears will flow stronger still!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_FINAL_1">Mmm, the precious fruit! So precious! And perhaps now, we have enough. Enough, enough! For our work often begins, but never ends!</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_PILGRIMSREST">Ah, hello again! What a blessing to see a familiar face on this treacherous climb.<hpage>Greetings, sir. I see you have begun your pilgrimage, or else set out for your own sake. Either way, I am glad to see you here unharmed.<page>Not quite unharmed... I’ve suffered my share of scrapes and burns. That’s just the nature of the journey, I suppose.<page>But I’ve seen so much! Great metal structures and vast scorched fields! The grandeur of it all is humbling indeed, even for one like me who was so humble to begin with.<page>I’ll rest here just a little longer before resuming my climb.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE">Mmm! Mmm! This is them, the precious, promised fruits!<page>Drop them in, there they go, and now at last we can begin!</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_MASK_SHARD_DESC">Just a piece of something greater, but finely crafted. You should take it with you, traveller, for luck.</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_FINAL_NONAME">Farewell, little pilgrim. May your shell harden the path for others to tread.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_BENCHREPAIR_REPEAT_ALT">Times like this, all we can do is put our heads down and try to rebuild.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_MEET_ACT3"><page>Mmmm! Is it time? Our lands shake their sorrow! For the new beat, yes? Demanding! For a new rhythm...<hpage>These quakes you feel, they are not your land’s sadness, they are its collapse, one bound to happen if their source cannot be quelled.<page>What? No, no no... the beat... It is the beat our land wishes! Calls for it! Needs one new!</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_CURSED_REPEAT">Head quick for that vein of bells, and find my uncle hidden there. If anyone’s able to point you to a cure for that thing twisting within your shell, it’ll be him. </entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_INPROGRESS">Mmm! Mmm. Who are you, little you? Not a wish granter. For you haven’t enough fruits. Three we need, three I need! Find them, find them!</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_BENCHREPAIR">Ah! Here she is, safe after all! I was worried your battle with that enormous beast had left you badly wounded.<page>Shames me to have left you in danger there, missy, but I’m no warrior, and my tools ain’t no match for a creature like that.<hpage>It is well that you kept yourself safe. This settlement needs a fixer now, not a warrior.<page>Heh, maybe that’s true. Times like these all we can do is put our heads down and try to rebuild.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_ACT3_REPEAT">Rest here with us, long as you like. Mightn’t be much time left, but at least we few won’t have to face that fate alone.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_STATUE">Ah! Glad I caught you for a moment, miss. You’ve done a fair service to this camp, given much more’n most.<page>I’d been thinkin’ on all your efforts, and set to making a little something to repay ‘em.<page>S’only a token, really! But I’ve put all me talent into it, much as I’ve got! Something to keep you company on the lonely roads above.<page>Hold onto it on your travels, and remember that you’re always welcome down here with us.</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_CAMP"><hpage>This camp seems in poor condition, good bug. With the lands around turning deadly, I’d worry for its safety.<page>Aye. We surely aren’t seeing its finest moment, but this place has been serving us passing bugs for as long as any can remember.<page>It’s faith, you see! All those pilgrims, now and past. Our devotion holds it together. The camp’ll remain, and provide, no matter the troubles.<page></entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_1"><hpage>What ritual calls you all together, pilgrim?<page>Our brother, this poor wretch in my arms, has walked his last aching step. We gather here to sing him farewell, and to mourn our great loss.</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_TALK_02">If the veiled bugs have an interest in you, enough to brave the wastes beyond our borders, then you must be rather special, yes?<hpage>In my own lands, some may once have seen me so. In this place, with my strength sapped, I am just another traveller.<page>Ohho! A traveller, but still something more. I can see it now. Of course! That focus!<page>Did those veiled bugs realise who they snared? Perhaps it is they who should be worried, eh?</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_REOFFER">My wish. Oh my wish! I need fruits of the world, three little darlings. I need them! Does the kingdom not send you, little you, to grant my desire?</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_MEET_1">Ahh, awake at last! You should mind your strength, traveller. There’s no use wasting energy on an old nobody like me.<hpage>I see that now, madam. My welcome to your land has not been kind. I had reason to be wary.</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_PRE_MEET">Up with you! Up! I won’t have you dying on my floor!</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_MEET_3"><hpage>I am no pilgrim. I am Hornet, and I arrive in your land by no choice of my own.<hpage>I was brought to your kingdom by force, captured by strange bugs clad in veils.<page>Oho! How curious! The bugs of the Citadel, at the summit of our land. They veil themselves in service to their faith, or perhaps as slaves to something greater...<hpage>Then I shall seek their Citadel. If the veiled bugs would go to such lengths to bring me here, I intend to find out why.<page>Oho! Ferocious! Intimidating! Yours is no pilgrim’s spirit! You’ve the bearing of a hunter.<page>Welcome then, fierce traveller, to Pharloom! Our holy yet haunted land.<page>Before you depart, permit an old bug a brief warning. Best keep that weapon drawn.<page>Our kingdom is gripped by a curse. Its paths grow wild and dangerous, and though some still attempt the climb to the Citadel at its crest, none return to speak of what they see.</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_MEET_2">So you’re another pilgrim then? Scuttled out of the darkness to climb the great path and bow at its gilded peak?</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_Q1_COMPLETE">Well, look at that! You’ve gone and donated all those shell shards, just like I wished for! I can scarcely believe it!<page>Those shards are valuable, alright. Brilliant for crafting and fixing, very versatile.<page>More than that, though... it was a warm thing you did, the sort of kindness you don’t see much in this weary place.<hpage>Was this kindness? I must take care to learn of this land and claim what advantage I can from it. Answering requests like yours can often fit those ends.<page>Oh, it’s like that, is it? Well, even still, the help’s well appreciated, miss. Best of luck in your travels, and may every wish of yours be granted!</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_POST_BOSS">Oh, oh dear... what fearful events are sent to test we poor pilgrims! How could it be that our path to paradise is infested with such beasts?<page>To brave such a world... oh my. I’ll need more rosaries, that’s for certain. Please traveller, won’t you trade with me?</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_WISHWALL">You are my wish granter, yes? My wish! I need fruits of the world, three little darlings. I need them, so I wish!<page>You made the promise. A binding stronger than sin. Bring me the three Mossberries. Precious fruit! Grant my wish, and then the work begins!</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_PILGRIMSREST_REPEAT">I’ve a long way to go, and much more to see. For now though, let’s just rest a little while, eh?</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_GENERIC">Times are hard, so fresh supplies are always welcome! Bugs arrive here with nothin’ and often leave without much more.</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_NOSTOCK">Well now! Seems I’ve traded you the last of my supplies, so I’ve got no more excuses to linger down here.<page>I’ll soon be making my way up to the great Citadel. As holy as I am with rosaries, I’m sure my path will not be an arduous one...</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_NOBERRY">Bring more Mossberries here. Mmm. Yes, we will trade. Precious rosaries for fresh berries! Seek them wherever you see the green moss grow!</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_TALK_01">You bear your blade well, hunter, and you’ve skill, no doubt, so I don’t mean any unkindness when I say you still seem a little frail.<hpage>I was a long time spent captive, bound by seals strange to me. My strength is diminished, but recoverable.<hpage>By the time I reach that Citadel, I’ll be ready to face what waits.</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_CURSED">Oh! Hunter, aren’t you in a sorry state? You’re all bound up, looking worse than when we first met!<hpage>My shell has become host to a cruel parasite. Though my natural strength keeps it from consuming me entirely, I’m much weakened by its presence.<page>Well, this just won’t do! Pharloom’s already in the snare of one fell curse, we can’t have another vying to leech what life remains.<page>Best you head quick over to that town of bells, at the core of our kingdom. I’ve an uncle hidden about there, an old hermit, and a horrid curmudgeon.<page>That hermit’s a hard one to befriend, but he holds some knowledge about this kingdom’s maladies. If anyone’s able to point you to a cure, it’ll be him.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_ACCEPT_3">Mmm, the precious fruit! And... oh! Such fruit! Perfectly ripe! Perfectly fragrant! Perfectly round! Take what you have earned, much of much rosaries!</entry>
<entry name="BB_SHOPKEEP_MEET_ALT">O-oh! Traveller! Won’t you stop and make trade with an old pilgrim? Surely something here will aid you in your great journey!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_REFUSE">You keep the fruit for yourself? For greed? Strange choice! It will only weigh you down...</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_STATUE_REPEAT">Don’t go thinkin’ fear’s keepin’ me from my own pilgrimage! S’just there’s a lotta work still to do here and few bugs able to do it.</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_4">Sing for our brother, who has died a devout death! All his pains and torments left behind, like the dust shrugged from a traveller’s shawl.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_ACCEPT">Promised, then. A binding stronger than sin. Bring me the three Mossberries. Precious fruit! Grant my wish, and then the work begins!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_MEET">Mm. Mmm! Who is it? An intruder! Terrible! To interrupt a humble druid as they work!<hpage>I meant no intrusion, druid. The sound of your laughter drew me to investigate.<hpage>This settlement is built around an old structure of the Weavers. Do you know of them? Do they inhabit this land still?<page>Mm? What settlement? What Weavers?! You speak nonsense!</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_SNARE"><hpage>Madam, I return seeking power to aid the construction of a trap, at request of your sibling residing atop the Citadel.<page>Aye, hunter. So you managed to rouse the old fool. I’ve known it coming, felt it, and glad I am! <page>Rest’a my family spent far too long huddled and glum... or dead! Not me! I’d always been thinkin’ it a waste to just take what’s coming, when her up top wakes.<page>Better to fight for freedom or go out in a blaze, oh ho!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_ACCEPT_1">Mmm, the precious fruit! Ah... but! This one is not so fresh. Rotten! Stench of death! A meagre amount of rosaries for you. As much as you deserve!</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_NAME_1"><hpage>Pilby. This pilgrim’s name was Pilby.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_REPEAT">Once this wishwall is up, bugs’ll be able to seek help from any able shell around. You could even try granting a couple of wishes yourself, missy!</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_REPEAT">Rest here with me as long as you like. I’m not ready to leave yet, and a little company is always nice.</entry>
<entry name="BELLWAY_PILGRIM_REPEAT">Down here, you can’t hear the cries of the pilgrims above, only the faintly ringing bells. I’ll stay and meditate a little longer, before I start my own pilgrimage...</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_FINAL_NAME">Farewell, brother Pilby. May your shell harden the path for others to tread.</entry>
<entry name="BELLWAY_PILGRIM_AFTER_TRAVEL">Beast! B-b-beast! Horrible beast!</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_3">...Hm. Who here knows the name of this little pilgrim?</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_Q1_COMPLETE_R">Common stuff, shell shards, but very practical. I can use ‘em to patch almost anything up, and this camp’s always in need of some mending. </entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_BENCHREPAIR_REPEAT">And another poor pilgrim lost, eh? Just the thought of it makes me weary. Better to put my head down and work ‘til the job’s done...</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_MEET">Hm? A fellow pilgrim, are you? About to start your great journey to the holy Citadel up top?<hpage>I am no pilgrim, sir, though it seems we will be travelling a similar path.<page>Not a pilgrim? Well, it makes no difference, I suppose. We all must walk the roads, up and up, though most of us will fall long before we see the grand gates.<page>If you’re wise, you’ll stop here and rest a while before heading out into that dangerous world...</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_D">And for the parting, a gift. An amulet of we druids. Or me druid? No others, I think.<page>May it ease your sorrows, wish granter. May it cry for you when no tears are left!</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_TRADE_BERRY">Mmm! Mmm! You carry a sweet, precious smell with you. A fruit! Will you trade it for rosaries?</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_TALK"><hpage>I wonder, little pilgrim. What calls you and your fellows up to the Citadel? If the way is dangerous, why take the journey at all?<page>Strange question to be asking of a pilgrim. Our holy land calls on us. To journey up is our greatest task. Who are we to refuse?<page>Guided by faith, we climb through flaming fields, across rolling moors, and up great gilded steps. All to reach that eternal, shining Citadel.<page>Once I’m good and ready, I’ll make the climb myself...</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_C">Mmm. Mmm! The pain... my mind aches. Why? The berries, the nasty fruits. Oh the visions!<page>You, wish promiser. Wish granter. You brought me what I needed and stayed by my side. Companion through my ordeal. I could ask for nothing more.</entry>
<entry name="MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_B">Ahhh! Ahhh-ohhhh! The smell is right! Like the others! But very young! Oh, voice of the woods! Oh, dance of the queen! Oh... oh! Beat harder, let us hear it! Oh! Ohhhhhhhh!</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_2b">Sing, brothers and sisters! Sing, and drown out this burdensome sorrow! Sing out the name of this poor pilgrim, whose journey had nary begun! </entry>
<entry name="BELLWAY_PILGRIM_TALK_1">Have you heard the talk of what waits just beyond this camp?<page>Brittle caverns of bone, the very base of Pharloom, filled with all manner of deadly creatures and jagged dangers.<page>It’s said ancient bugs once made their homes amidst it.<page>Who could believe! In such a hostile, unstable place! In all my time, I’ve never met a bug so brave.</entry>
<entry name="BB_PILGRIM_HORNED">Sister, sister! What is that long, gleaming tooth you carry with you? Is it a weapon?<hpage>It is indeed, though you need not fear. I will not raise it against you. Its edge is meant for predators and other foes.<hpage>I strongly suggest you arm yourself similarly before your own journey begins.<page>Alas... for a pilgrim, that’s sin you speak of, sister.<page>We arm ourselves with prayer, garb ourselves in faith, and hope they prove enough to reach the Citadel’s glory. Such is our way...</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_Q1_INTRO">Oh! Back again? The wishwall is up! Ready for all the poor souls who’ve been left behind down here.<page>In Pharloom, wishes are granted to those truly devout, or so they say. And there ain’t no harm in us dregs having wishes too.<page>Why, I even went and added a little wish of my own to the wishwall! Fair’s fair. I did build the thing. Seems like the kingdom should be granting my wish before anyone else’s.</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_MEET"><hpage>What’s this you’re building, sir? A sign of some kind?<page>Aye, aye. You’re a sharp bug! A wishwall. It’s past time this old camp had one. As the resident fixer, I’ve taken it upon myself to sort it out.<page>They’re a popular thing about Pharloom, wishwalls. Useful too. So many prayers left unanswered. Gives ‘em a place to go.</entry>
<entry name="BB_PILGRIM_ROUND_REPEAT">I must listen carefully... and pray with uninterrupted devotion. Only then will my faith be strong enough... to carry me upward...</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT">S’not a surprise it’s you rallying us to action, hunter. You had the sense about you, a bug bringing change’n all.<page>Course you’re more than just a bug, aint’cha! More than Weaver. Guess it’d take someone like you for my family to dare hope at success.<page>Go and prove our trust now, won’t you? We’ve spent our lifetimes wishing for another path. With a bit of luck, you might grant it.</entry>
<entry name="FUNERAL_NONAME">Well. Though this pilgrim’s name has been lost, still we sing.</entry>
<entry name="BB_RESIDENT_GOT_SPRINT">Been hearing awful whispers in camp, about pilgrims driven mad by the hardships of the climb, crying out and attacking their fellows.<page>You’ve been out there. Tell me, is it really so?<hpage>You’ve heard it true, sir. On the roads, both pilgrims and beasts alike are consumed, driven to violence by a haunted thread, the source of which I have yet to discover.<page>Ah... I’d feared it was so. I won’t be able to trust a single face out on the path, then.<page>The risk of death was daunting enough, but the loneliness of such a journey, that seems almost too much to bear... Ah well. Just another test of our devotion, I suppose.</entry>
<entry name="BB_PILGRIM_HORNED_REPEAT">We pilgrims arm ourselves with prayer, garb ourselves in faith, and hope they prove enough to reach the Citadel’s glory. Such is our way...</entry>
<entry name="BB_CARETAKER_TALK_03"><hpage>What duty binds you to this old chapel, madam? The structure barely stands, and I see no signs of congregation.<page>Aye! Gone! The lot’o them, fled and hidden. But I’m not leaving till I’ve set this place right...<page>...It’s that Citadel above, you see. Even now, in Pharloom’s long decline, the simple bugs, they’re witless before it. Too grand. Too majestic. Too powerful.<page>This building’s state is a sad example of those who’d dare suggest another path...</entry>
<entry name="BB_FIXER_ACT3_DELIVERY">Eh? What fortune is this? Our wish answered, even in a moment so dark!<page>You’ve proved quite the saviour, miss, and you’ve certainly earned the appreciation of this whole sorry lot.<hpage>You are welcome, sir. For you few, I hope these supplies may aid.</entry>

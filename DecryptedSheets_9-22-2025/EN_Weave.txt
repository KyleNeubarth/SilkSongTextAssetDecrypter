<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_PT2"><page>No. Not their enemy, and their prisoner not through malice. I am Eva, a thing... difficult to describe, a child of Weavers, yet not quite their kin...<hpage>How strange. That description could fit me as well as yourself. <page>Child of Weavers?... And not? I can detect your Weaver strain, yet you are different from them, and from me, a shifting, blended thing? What are you creature?<page>Step closer, lady, that my senses would better understand your nature.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_REPEAT_ADDITIONAL">Lady, still my senses resound. You seem so far beyond the bounds of a bug.<page>Permit me to gaze again upon your nature, that I may offer clarity.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_ACT3">Lady? So you live, still. This is good... I had felt the conflict commence, pale hearts ablaze, and the sudden well of darkness after.<hpage>I am sorry, Eva. I had hoped to slay the monarch, and was near achieving that goal, but the situation has become... complicated. Now, all of Pharloom threatens to fall.<page>But I can sense it in you, lady. You have not yielded to despair, so some hope must still remain?<hpage>...Slim hope, I suspect. But true, there may yet be a way through this disaster. I shall pursue that goal with whatever strength remains.<page>Then allow me to continue to aid you as I can... Mine might be a small contribution, but I shall provide it eagerly.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_POST_ADDITIONAL_AVAILABLE">Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bug’s. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing, worth my long life to behold.<page>With what power I possess, I may still be able to aid you further. </entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_TALK_SNARE"><hpage>Eva, I am seeking a tool, told to be somewhere in this structure. It is a snare device of Weaver make. Do you know of it?<page>I may, lady. Search over from here, on side where the moss meets the nest. There, my mothers built their tools, all traps and bindings. Small things, but tests for larger forms.<page>I still remember their thoughts as they worked, their desperation, and their hunger. Another hopeless attempt to wrest their freedom. All ended in failure, of course.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_READY">Ain’t you come a long way, bellringer! Granting wishes, saving bugs, even rousing my sullen family to act!<page>The snare is set above, our power bound along its thread. To your sight it may seem a crude thing, but there’s fair strength to it... enough to quell a god.<hpage>You and your family have done me well, sir. I shall prove your faith in the meeting ahead.<page>Aye. Bring your best, bellringer. Call forth our great pale god. Cut her weak, then drive the beast down atop the snare.<page>Contact made will stir the snare alight, but only your needle’s song will awaken the spell in full. When that moment arrives, you’ll see it clear.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_RETURNED"><page>Lady, please. Permit me to look upon your nature, that I may offer clarity...</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_POST">Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bug’s. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing, worth my long life to behold.<page>If in your travels you are able to further evolve, return to me. With what power I possess, I may be able to aid you further.<hpage>Thank you, Eva. If my nature expands as you say, I shall return. </entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_TALK1"><hpage>I have known your kind before, sir. Yours is a tribe that works and trades in power, and I am about to extinguish its prime source.<hpage>Once this is done, will you truly delight in a land so bereft?<page>Aye, well... My family’s marks are all over that trap. And we’ve spent a hard age avoiding the gaze of our god.<page>If we earned it now, after such open opposition... that’s a bleak conclusion none of us’d care for.<page>Now! My job’s done. S’time your grand business began! We’ll be wishin’ victory to you, bellringer, for all our sakes!</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE"><hpage>You see one’s nature, Eva? It is a skill far beyond bugs.<page>One not without cost. My sight perceives a bug only through the imprint upon their soul. <hpage>You speak of their crest? That signifier of a bug’s essence and their invisible yoke born through a lifetime.<page>Crest? Yes, the old Weaver term. A simple word to attempt description of something so profound.<page>But wait. Your own nature... Is it?...<page>Lady, permit me to look deeper still, that I may offer clarity...</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PROMPT">Allow Insight?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_REPEAT_ACT3">Lady, Pharloom’s time grows short. If you are able to further expand your nature, I urge you return to me.<page>Any power I possess, I shall grant it for your aid.<hpage>My thanks, Eva. If my nature expands as you say, I shall return. </entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_ACCEPT_DIALOGUE">Bind Eva?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_CURSED">Stay back, twisted leech! Even lodged within another’s shell, your ravenous nature shines clear.<page>You shall not defoul this chamber, nor claim my soul. Begone!</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_FIRST_ALL">Lady... Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bugs. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing. Worth my long life to behold.<page>Unbound one, though we know each other little, permit me to ask a selfish request.<hpage>Your talent has provided a great benefit, Eva. What is it you desire of me?<page>Only to have my own soul, my own memories, bound within your shell... As you have done with those others throughout these lands.<page>I would not define as a crest within you, but my small strength may still grant a final boon.<hpage>You ask to be subsumed? Know your mind would cease to be, in any independent sense.<page>To be united with one unbound... This is the kind of escape I once prayed for, though the weight of ages had almost made me forget.<page>Lady, would you grant me this request?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_ALL">Lady, you are a multitude within a single shell. A being truly unbound. To aid your growth has proved a grand task, even for one as limited as me.<page>As my last act, permit me to ask a final, selfish request.<hpage>Your talents have provided great benefit, Eva. What is it you desire of me?<page>Only to have my own soul, my own memories, bound within your shell... As you have done with those others throughout these lands.<page>I would not define as a crest within you, but my small strength may still grant a final boon.<hpage>You ask to be subsumed? Know your mind would cease to be, in any independent sense.<page>I know. And still I seek it, gladly. To be united with one unbound... This is the kind of escape I once prayed for, though the weight of ages had almost made me forget.<page>Dear Lady, would you grant me this request?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET">Who’s there? Has someone come to free me? Or are you here to bring my end? <hpage>I am Hornet, prisoner, only a traveller and not here to slay you.<hpage>What cause sees you caged in these ruins of Weavers past? Were you their enemy?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_REPEAT">Lady, my senses resound. You have grown further beyond the bounds of a bug.<page>Permit me to gaze again upon your nature, that I may offer clarity.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_TALK_PURPOSE"><hpage>How did you come to be sealed here, Eva? <page>Lady, you mistake. What seems a cage is as much my shell as the form inside.<page>I was born within this space. To leave would be my death, an uninspired end, though one I’ve sometimes wished would come.<page>I am unique, you see. My mothers shared the curse of their tribe, to conceive a child is a painful, near impossible task. <hpage>I know the curse well, Eva, for I am also its victim, and spawn of one who managed to overcome its limits. <hpage>Are you too an attempt to defy that cruel constraint?<page>A flawed attempt. A life spun from rune and shell, sustained only by its cage. My thoughts may mimic a Weavers, but my senses are my own.<page>Over time, that difference brought only distance between us.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_ACCEPT">By your grace, I am at last broken from my fate.<hpage>Gladly I accept your union, Eva. No longer shall you suffer eternity alone.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_OVERBLUE">Come no closer! I sense the forbidden blood coursing through you, that which grows and reshapes the world in its own vulgar image.<page>Whether it was imbibed willingly or not, none shall be allowed into this chamber while so afflicted. Begone!</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_REPEAT">Lady, if in your travels you are able to further expand your nature, return to me. With what power I possess, I may be able to aid you further.<hpage>If my nature expands as you say, Eva, I shall return. </entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_REOFFER">Lady, would you think again upon my last request? To be bound amidst your shimmering soul?<page>I understand it is a selfish thing to ask, and I will hold no ill will if you reject.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_DECLINE"><hpage>I am sorry, Eva. I cannot grant you this. At least, not yet.<hpage>Yours is a mind strong and strange. That union could prove dangerous to my identity.<page>I understand, Lady. I will be here, if ever you reconsider.</entry>

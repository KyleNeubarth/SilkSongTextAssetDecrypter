<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_PROMPT">Purchase Vintage Nectar?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_GREET_ACT3">Ho, traveller! With the lands outside fresh struck by fell events, it’s good to see someone still survivin’.<hpage>This new curse proves a threat even to my strengthened shell. For your own safety, barkeep, I strongly suggest you remain within your walls.<page>Aye, well, you’re welcome to do the same. Stay and wash the troubles away with a few bells of nectar... though, given the scale to them shakes, I’m thinkin’ it might take more’n just a few.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_CURSED">Phew. You’re lookin’ a bit raw there, miss. I’m thinkin’ it’ll take more than my nectar to fix you up.<hpage>A parasite of your land has twisted itself into my shell. Its writhing is causing some discomfort.<hpage>If not for my unique constitution, I suspect it would have already consumed me entirely.<page>Well, don’t be bringing such dangerous things in here! Head to the top of the moors. There’s an old doctor up there hiding in her bell.<page>Her remedies are said to often hurt more’n they help, but given your state, I’d say it’s worth the risk.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_OFFER"><hpage>Bartender, I’ve been tasked to acquire a nectar of significant age. Would you retain any such drink?<page>After the finer stuff, eh? Sure, I might have a few vessels left, but I can’t be selling ‘em cheap.<page>The shells in my cellar are the last left in Pharloom. Once they’re gone, no bug’ll ever taste such sweetness again.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_DRINK_DECLINED"><hpage>Another time, perhaps. Among the few gifts of my birth, I find rare need for sustenance.<page>S’at so? Well the nectar’s always on tap if you find yourself feelin’ different.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_REOFFER"><page>Thinkin’ again on the Vintage Nectar?<page>My price might seem steep, but I assure you, the few finer bugs who passed used to pay a lot more.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_REPEAT">Any chance you’d reconsider dealing with my blasted craw problem? I’d offer fair reward for your efforts.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_QUEST">Traveller, I’m not wanting to impose, but I’ve a wish that one of your able sort could likely grant.<hpage>I’ve my own task to attend, good sir, but I’ll hear you out.<page>It’s those blasted craws atop here. My roof is fast becoming their cosy nest! Now they’ve grown so bold they’re starting to attack pilgrims as they pass.<hpage>Would you simply have them slain? If so, your sturdy shell seems more than up to that task?<page>If only it were so simple. Kill the ones above, and more just keep coming. It’s the warmth of this home you see. Draws ‘em right in.<page>I’m looking for a long-term solution. A scarecraw! I’ll build the biggest there’s ever been, so fearsome it’ll keep those craws away for good!</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_LEFT_TALK_1">Tis a blessed bit of luck to find this place, eh, sister?<page>The climb’s proved harder than even my best guessin’, but there’s still some vigour left in these old limbs. Doubly so, now I have a belly full of nectar!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_REPEAT">Care for a drink, traveller? My nectar’s got a kick that’ll warm your shell in these sodden climes.</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_RIGHT_TALK_1">Hoy... sister! I’m sat here all bent and bedraggled, but you look fresh as the day you was hatched!<page>How do you fare so well in these drenched and dangerous lands? Maybe you got a secret you could share?<hpage>None that would offer easy aid, good bug. Whatever luck or savvy brought you this far, may it continue on your journey.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_DECLINE"><hpage>For now, bartender, I cannot spare so many rosaries.<page>Suit yourself. Maybe you’d rather a pour of the cheap stuff? Give your shell a kick before you head out into our blighted lands.  </entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_BELLHARTHAUNTED"><hpage>My travels took me through a town beside your moors, in a vein of old bells. Its residents are bound upon a vicious thread.<page>Ahh. So Pharloom’s curse has strung’em tight. A frightful thing. Word’d long gone silent from over their way.<hpage>I suggest you pass warning to your patrons, bartender. If they’re travelling the bellside paths, best they give that place wide berth.<page>Aye. I’ll let’em know, traveller, though in these cursed times, does any safe path still exist?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_CURSED_REPEAT">Best be visiting that doctor right quick, miss! She’s up there, at the top of the moors, over toward the bellvein.<page>Her methods might be suspect, but you’re lookin’ sorely in need of service.</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_LEFT_TALK_REPEAT">Might have taken me a beat to build the courage, but I can feel it, closer now... the Citadel calling me up.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE"><hpage>Here is the Ragpelt, sir. I hope the amount is sufficient for your work.<page>Aye. This should be enough. Once I find a quiet moment, I’ll get straight to building that mighty scarecraw.<page>With a little luck, my roof should be clear of those pests when next you pass by. Thank you kindly, traveller!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_ACTIVE">If you’re collecting Ragpelt from the crawbugs, those young’ns above here’ll be slim pickings. It’s the mature craws you want, over by the watermound. They’ll drop the stuff a-plenty.<page>Course, you’ll need to do some pointed persuading if you’re planning to separate rag from bug...</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_GOT">You’re back, miss! Heard a little commotion below. I trust everything went... erm, smoothly?<hpage><hpage>Sir, your cellar seems to have an ant problem. I assume, in sending me down, it merely slipped your mind to mention?<page>Ah... Oh yes! Well, with your weapon, and talent, and what... I’m sure they didn’t pose a problem? Ahem.<page>And why! I see you’ve collected your prize, so we’ve both come out well from the trade!<page>Enjoy your nectar, miss. No simple pilgrim will ever taste a drop so fine.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_DECLINE_QUEST">Ahh. Fair enough, traveller. You’ve clearly got your own tasks to be on with. I’ll manage, no doubt.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE_2">As payment goes, I’ve got something I think you’d make good use of. A spare crafting kit.<page>I’d been holding onto it for someone else, but they’ve been gone long enough now, I know they won’t be returning.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE_3"><hpage>Thank you sir. This is a worthy trade for my work. My tools shall attain an even sharper edge.</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_RIGHT_TALK_REPEAT">My sore shell will cease tormenting me once I reach the Citadel. It’s sung that all ails are healed just as soon as we step beyond the Grand Gate...</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_ACCEPT">Aye. A fair trade. The aged stuff’s down at the bottom of the cellar.<page>I’ll trust you to collect only the vessel you’re owed. I’d be grabbing it myself, but it’s become a hard climb for my stiffened shell.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_1">S’only those few stronger pilgrims that survive to reach my home now... Pharloom’s curse claims the rest. Poor sods, left to wander.<page>I do sometimes get to wondering... Is it the dregs of their own mind in there keepin’em walking, or something else entirely...?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_2">Bellhart, over the moors, a great town I’ve heard it once was, heart of the path’n all, right smack in the middle of these midlands.<page>Now it’s all a’crumble... And that brittle vein of bells is crawling with nasties. Ain’t no place left in Pharloom that can fairly claim to offer safety. </entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_3">You visited them pens up above here, miss? Horrid place, once all about growing meat or some such. Meant to keep us moorbugs livin’, and working, its told...<page>That damned place’s long gone to the Haunting. And now the meat’s running feral and free.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_CANCOMPLETE">Welcome back, traveller. How’d you get along with collecting the Ragpelt from those mangy crawbugs? Their squawking and crooing up there is starting to wear mightily on my patrons!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_DRINK_PROMPT">Buy a drink?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_DECLINEPELTS">Hmm, holding on to them, eh? I won’t ask why, but I’d sure appreciate it if you reconsider.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_PAID">Planning to grab that Vintage Nectar? You passed a fair bundle of rosaries for the bottle, so I figured you’ll be eager to see it yours.<page>The old stuff’s down there, at the bottom of the cellar. I’ll keep the trap open for you, just be swift. </entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_GREET">Harh! Well met, traveller. Lookin’ for a drink, or a rest, or both?<hpage>Fair greetings, good bug. The warmth of your hearth is welcome upon these wet plains.<page>Aye. It’s a damp climb through these parts. Used to be just pilgrims trekkin’ my way, but odd times these are, and you ain’t even the strangest shell wandering about.<page>A rowdy old warrior stopped through not long back, caused quite a scene, and now a young lass’s taken up lodging in my top room.<page>The lass mentioned she’s on the lookout for sharp types like yourself. Maybe pay her a visit, if you haven’t already?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_ACCEPT_QUEST">Excellent, excellent! Let’s give those mangy craws the fright of their lives! Hah!<page>All I need is some Ragpelt from the crawbugs themselves. Hunt ‘em down, collect their pelts, and bring me back a heap of the stuff. I’ll do the rest!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_ACTIVE_2">The sooner you’ve collected that Ragpelt, the better. I can’t have those pests killing more potential guests.<page>Business is slow enough already, and clearing corpses ain’t no fun at all.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_REPEAT_ACT3">Wantin’ for a drink, traveller? Might soon be the end for all’o us, so no need to go easy on the nectar.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_QUEST_WISHWALL"><hpage>Barkeep, I have seen your request on the bell town’s wishwall. What assistance are you seeking?<page>Ah! Perfect! You’re the able sort that’ll make short work of the task.<page>The problem is those blasted craws atop here. My roof is fast becoming their cosy nest! Now they’ve grown so bold they’re starting to attack pilgrims as they pass.<hpage>Would you simply have me slay them? Your sturdy shell seems more than up to that task.<page>If only it were so simple. Kill the ones above and more just keep coming. It’s the warmth of this home you see. Draws ‘em right in.<page>I’m looking for a long-term solution. A scarecraw! I’ll build the biggest there’s ever been, so fearsome it’ll keep those craws away for good!<page>All I need is some Ragpelt from the crawbugs themselves. Hunt ‘em down, collect their pelts, and bring me back a heap of the stuff. I’ll do the rest!</entry>

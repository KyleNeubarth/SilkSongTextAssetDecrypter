<entry name="PILGRIM_LARGE_SK_SAVED_ACT3_REPEAT">That golden knight’s out there, sister, cutting down the lost, keeping us safe.<page>Reckon this place would’ve already been overrun if not for them’n their noble blades.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_DELIVERY_POST">Take some beads for your effort, miss bellringer, and know this sad lot’ll be survivin’ a little longer thanks to you.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_COMPLETE_POST">S’done! The parts are prepared. I’m headin’ up now to set the heavy thing.<page>Even with the trap laid, best be guessin’ her on top won’t go down so simple. She’ll sense what’s comin’.<page>That blade of yours is gonna have to do its work ‘fore this thing can snap.<hpage>I’d expected such, sir. And I am ready. Set your snare. I shall attend shortly.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_SHOP_REPEAT_ACT3">Everything is falling apart, my dear one. Be sure to share your rosaries with me before it’s too late!</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_TALK1">Lots of stories being sung about you, dear one. Gathering supplies, saving lost bugs... all sorts of good deeds!<page>Very clever to craft such a reputation for yourself. If you keep it up, you’ll fast become a legend among these simple sorts.<hpage>I’ve no interest in becoming one, madam. In my long life, I’ve known enough legends, watched them rise and fall and fade away, many times.<page>Is that so, dear? How humble you are! You should know though, this old pilgrim has her sight keenly trained on you! Nothing gets by old Jubilana!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_MEET_2">It was you, wasn’t it? Ringin’ that great clanging bell just now! Right when I’m tryin’ to get some sleep!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_LARGE_REPEAT">Please don’t go too far, sister. Right here’s the only safety you’ll find within this whole cursed place.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_BRIDGE_REPEAT">There must be a few more goodies to gather up here, and I don’t need you lingering around in the meantime. Blessings, and farewell!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_LV1_MEET">Well, well! See here what your brash behaviour has wrought, bellringer!<page>Just as I predicted, this once-peaceful sanctuary is now crawling with all sorts. We’ve the beginnings of a shabby little settlement, all huddled around this old shrine!<hpage>These poor bugs, all are victims of the Citadel and its insidious attraction. This place draws them up, into its maw, only to consume them, utterly.<page>Aye, inside and out, s’nothing but a grand, gilded lie. Well, at least these few stragglers can enjoy a moment’s safety. Poor fools...</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SEAL_CHIT">A precious order passed down by the holy conductors. Rare now to find these old texts, and rarer still to find a bug able to read ‘em.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_SAVED_1">Ooh, what a turn-up! I’d feared t’was naught but meself left sane about these halls. Seems this old bug’s luck has not yet worn thin!<hpage>It was more than luck that saw me to you, madam. I promised the wish of bugs concerned for your safety.<hpage>I urge you to head their way now, beside the old bell, up and over.<hpage>A small settlement has formed there, and the bell, reawakened, seems to ward away the worst of the Citadel’s many dangers.<page>A settlement? In these long-haunted halls? Are you telling naughty little lies, dear one? Well, I suppose there’s not too much danger in going and seeing the truth for meself.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_SAVED_2">Be away then, dear one, and leave me to gather up my trinkets and baubles.<page>If this settlement of yours truly has bugs settled safe, I’ll be able to make some lucrative trades. Blessings and farewell!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_OFFER">It’s feelin’ almost time, eh, bellringer? You and her who waits up there. That fated meeting won’t hold forever... Ready to make your play, to oust one ruler and claim her place?<hpage>I’ll not deny some part of me desires that outcome... Dominance, it seems, is baked deep in my blood, as too, no doubt, for the one up top.<hpage>And yet, another part resists... A part, over time, I find myself siding with more...<hpage>That part wishes not to claim a monarch’s mantle, rather it would see my freedom regained, and this kingdom’s bugs unshackled from their pale chains.<page>...Remarkable idea you’re speakin’ there, bellringer, a world cut free. Not a wish I’ve had much cause to hope on, serious like... but I ain’t so surprised to hear you speak it.<page>For all your helpin’, I been seein’ it clearer. You’ve still got the monarch in you, alright, and the glare of a Weaver, but the ambition... that’s wild different from both.<hpage>If you have already guessed to my desire, sir, and share some part of it, would you offer me aid in the conflict to come?<page>Aye... Maybe, yes. I can barely bear to tell it... But there’s an idea, one rare discussed, for fear of her up there sensin’ the score.<hpage>You have conceived a method, I take it? A way to see a monarch... removed? And me left free from claiming her station?<page>...We have, me and what remains of my family. S’a trap, of a sort, beyond the skill of this Citadel, one to go further than just her binding. You’d be just the hunter to set it, if you’re dare enough to try...</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SWAMP_SOUL">What’s that you got there, bellringer? Stole someone else’s soul for yourself?<hpage>You speak of the remnant I found in the muck-choked caves beside the Citadel? This is soul siphoned from a once powerful bug.<hpage>It’s only a thin mix now, but there is still some strength left. At peak, their talents must have been impressive.<page>Aye, they was that. I knew the bug, in ‘is prime, long time back. Braver’n most, and as little a fan of this Citadel as you yourself.<page>Went seekin’ alliance with those basic bugs of the swamps. Thought they’d both gain from the union... Scheming defiance, or some such stupidity!<page>Now he’s as dead as he was daft! Don’t go tryin’ ta make friends in Pharloom, bellringer. Nothin’ good comes of it.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_BEAST">Hmph. Bellringer, you might think me a dullard, but I understand this place and have well-good senses.<page>Brought here, weren’t you? From beyond the border of our lands?<hpage>You are correct. The one who waits atop this Citadel... Through their hospitality, I arrived in this kingdom. I seek now to return that welcome in kind.<page>Hmph. Beastly words, them. Finely spoken, but beastly all the same.<page>I just pray you don’t bring any more unneeded pain down on the heads of these gormless little pilgrims...</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_COMPLETE_PREPARE">Found it all, did ya, bellringer? Then join me and let’s get to preppin’! I’ll be askin’ both your Silk and your claws ‘fore the construction.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_SMALL_02">The Citadel chose us, granted us a little more living. For what purpose though, who could say?</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT">If’n your wantin’ that trap made, you’d best get to collectin’. I’ll point you toward what’s needed, best as I can.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_MERCHANT">Heard you did the savin’ for our dear merchant there? I’ve seen her about, sneaking and scrounging, even a’fore you was ringing that bell.<page>She’s a useful sort, but don’t let her age be foolin’, she’s still the sharpest mind for a deal.<page>Won’t be long till there’s nary a rosary about this shrine that ain’t found its way into her pockets.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_REOFFER">Bellringer... Re-thinkin’ on that trap, are ya? It’s a mad method, for sure, but you’d be just the hunter to set it, if’n you’re dare enough to try...</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_ACCEPT"><hpage>Grant me your aid, sir. If your trap provides a path to freedom, both for myself and your land’s bugs, I may indeed choose to trigger it.<hpage>What work do you require of me now to see your service made?<page>It’s my family’s strength you’ll need be seeking, bellringer, us three ol’ bugs still alive, spread ‘cross this kingdom, and one poor cousin dead and drained in swamps choked rotten.<page>Each has power. Raw, savage stuff! For you, they’ll give it, if for their fascination at the act, or the thrill of defiance... or because they have no choice at all.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_WARDKEY">Real fine key this. No doubt it’ll open the way to somewhere special. Somewhere full of goodies, I’ll bet. Find the lock, and it’ll practically pay for itself!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_DELIVERY"><hpage>Caretaker, I bring supplies from the town of bells below the Citadel.<page>And badly needed they are, miss bellringer. Ain’t much finding or foraging happening with this mob, what with them choir types all stalkin’ about the chambers beside.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT_BELLHERMIT">Buried in the warren of bells, at Pharloom’s core, seek my sullen uncle. That one has power to spare.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_SMALL_01">So you found this place too, sister? This Citadel’s grand promise has been strangled away by cursed thread, but at least the great bell here grants us some sanctuary.<page>We’re amongst the blessed few... granted just a little more living.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_REPEAT">Off you go now, dear one. If it’s my trinkets you covet, you can trade me your rosaries up at the shrine. Blessings and farewell!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_GENERIC_ACT3_REPEAT">Ooohh... If we’re no longer pilgrims... What are we?</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_TOOLMETAL">Crafty types used to go all a’clamour for this metal. S’not much to look at, but I still remember its value.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_MEET_1">Oi! You there!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_MEET_REPEAT">This shrine, awakened... it calls out to ‘em, you see. “It’s safe here. Come on over!” ringing in the ears of every lost pilgrim and grubby so-and-so unlucky enough to have made it to this blasted Citadel with their wits intact.<page>Well, what’s done is done, and what’s rung is rung. Just make sure you come back here soon, you lout! I ain’t dealing with all the fresh intake myself!<hpage>If time permits, sir bug, I shall visit again. </entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_DECLINE">Guess I shouldn’t be surprised. It’s a fool act to try such a thing... Maybe even to think on it. Your kind ain’t designed to die.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_ACCEPT_SNARE">For the last part, I’ll also be needin’ that rune setter you’re carryin’. Clever old Weaver tool, that thing, and the perfect base on which to stretch our power.<page>Once you’ve collected for yourself the other critical parts, I’ll ask you pass it over as well.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT_SWAMP">Find the husk of my cousin, claimed by the scorned bugs of the swamps. A careless fool to let himself be taken, and dead they might be, but some glimmer of his soul can still be sensed.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_COMPLETE_PRE"><hpage>Sir, I have the items requested. Craft me your trap that we may see these lands free.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_MEET_AFTERBRIDGE">T’was a good deed you did up above, dear one, saving me from them screeching flocks. Not seen the like of it in a long, long time.<page>I’ve returned with all sorts of new goodies, too. Let’s see if anything I’ve scavenged will fit your fancy.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_WISHES_PROGRESS">Don’t think I ain’t see’in it, bellringer! A whole lotta helpin’ you’ve been up to, both here and down below!<page>S’a strange mantle you’re takin’ for yourself, seeing all them bugs saved and wishes promised.<hpage>You find it strange, sir? I’ve found some solace in the service, and the rewards received have proved a boon on my journey.<page>Aye! But it ain’t your place now, is it? I see well what you are, Weaver’n more! It’s below your station! You ain’t no common sort meant for carin’ on us low folk.<hpage>I could say the same for you, who still chooses to remain cowled. You continue to pose as only a simple pilgrim. Don’t you think it’s past time you ceased the performance?<page>Leave off, Old One! Permit a bug their small disguise! It’s been a pleasant thing to play simple. And I weren’t calling for change, even if you seem insistent on bringing it!<hpage>Change was unavoidable, sir, whether I arrived or not. The monarch stirs. Its threads stretch far. My presence only accelerates the inevitable.<page>So what’re you hopin’ for, eh? Planning to usurp, to perch above us all as queen? Build up our hopes only to string us all in your own beastly web? Such is the way of Weavers and gods both...</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_LV3_MEET">You keep at all that helpin’, you’re gonna start inspiring it in others! Best you think serious about what effect you might be causin’, bellringer!<page>Too much hope could prove a dangerous thing, ‘specially for all these bugs starved so long of it.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_SAVED_BRIDGE_2">Now, why don’t you hurry back to the shrine and let them all know what a good job you’ve done?<page>There might be a few more goodies to gather up on my way back, and I don’t need you lingering around in the meantime. Blessings and farewell!</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SIMPLEKEY">Simply forged, and simply styled. Designed to open all sorts of different locks, if they be basic enough.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STANDARD_MEET">Sister, sister! Let me confide in you! As I ascended the Citadel’s chambers to reach this place, I swear I heard the laughter of a child!<page>Wasn’t much more than an echo, and I confess me fear’s been playing awful tricks on me... and yet that voice still keeps ringing in my head.<page>Surely though, no bug so young and lively could survive within those heartless halls?</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_LARGE_SK_SAVED_ACT3_MEET">Sister, you seen ‘em out there? Our new champion, that golden knight stalking the Citadel’s crumbling halls?<page>Tall, righteous bug. Not much for conversing. Still! I’d be long dead if not for their appearance.<page>And I ain’t the only one. Others have spoken of the knight’s timely deeds and rare bravery.<page>We’re desperate for any protection we can get, and that gleaming champion’s been offering their aid almost as much as you yourself.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_RUMMAGE_REPEAT">If you’re going to keep skulkin’ around here while I work, you may as well buy something. Take a look dear one, don’t be shy!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_ACCEPT_NO_SNARE">And last, as the base, seek a weapon of Weavers past. Should still be one left, down there in their largest nest, a snare to set a rune’o searing Silk. Our own trap’ll be woven tight about it.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_MEET_3">Admit it! You done it! You shifty li’l bell-runger!<hpage>You have chosen a curious place to rest, sir. Do you perhaps know something of this shrine and its companions in the lands below?<page>Oh, so you ask funny questions as well as cutting bells free, eh? You certainly ain’t a pilgrim, but you’re clearly not of the Choir either. No! I know exactly what you are...<page>A bell-ringing lout! A weirdo! Don’t you realise what you’ve done, waking that shrine back up?<page>That bell has rung out far and wide! The wretched and the lost will have heard its call. They’ll be making their way here now.<page>Well, what’s done is done, and what’s rung is rung. Just make sure you come back here soon, you lout! You can help me deal with all the dirty little pilgrims and desperate scavengers who turn up.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_COMPLETE_PRE_CANCEL">Oi! What’s this? Suddenly havin’ second thoughts? For sure it’s a frightful thing to attempt, but you’ve already put in all the leg work!<page>She up top’ll already be sensin’ your goal, vague-like maybe, but there ain’t no worth to backin’ out now.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SPOOLEXTEND">Stretch a spool out nice and long with this fine-wrought tool. The perfect purchase if you’re planning to hoard a lot of Silk for yourself!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_WISHES_PROGRESS_REPEAT">You keep at all that helpin’, you’re gonna start inspiring it in others! Best think serious about what effect you might be causin’, bellringer!<page>Too much hope could prove a dangerous thing, ‘specially for all these bugs starved so long of it.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_GENERIC_ACT3_MEET">Ooohh... What new horror now besets us?<page>Is this fresh punishment for our sins, or yet another test to prove our faith?<hpage>It is neither, good bug. In this disaster you bear no blame.<hpage>Hold close to your companions, and I will work swift to see this madness stilled.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT_SNARE">For the base, we’ll be needin’ a weapon of Weavers past. Search down low, aside the paths of bone, inside their largest nest. S’a snare device, one to set a rune’o searing Silk.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STANDARD_REPEAT">I swear I heard it, sister... That laugh! It almost sounded like they were enjoying themself...</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_NEEDOLIN_TOOL">Hold this while makin’ music and you’ll soon hear its function. Amplifies song, it does! Sends it out full and bright. Ideal if you’re ever planning on performing for a crowd.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_ROSARYSTRING">How about we get your loose beads all strung up safe? I’ll pinch a few for their braiding, but that’s surely worth it for the peace of mind.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_RUMMAGE_GRAND_FORUM">Ooh, I’m glad I wriggled my way over here! What a bounty’s been laid out by our benefactors, those generous Conductors! Giants amongst bugs they are, all-seeing and kind!<page>It’s beautiful here, and goodies are everywhere. Only enough for one though, deary, so don’t be greedy! You know I got here first. Blessings, and farewell! </entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_LARGE_MEET">You stay close, sister. Them halls beside are crawling with haunted husks.<page>Wandering will only bring death, pointed and painful!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_WARD">Have you done it yet, bellringer? Wriggled deep? Discovered the depths of obsession that brought this place so low?<hpage>If you speak of this Citadel and its Silk, Caretaker, then yes, I now know the start of it. <hpage>In the ward down below, I saw it clear, the hollowed husks, and the many torturous implements... machines to instill a bug with thread, that would see their life extended.<page>Aye! That’s it, in part! But there’s more scale to it than all that. Just think of’em greedily shoving the Silk into their shells, the madness that overcame them, eternal life for mortal bugs! Then think on how long it’s all gone on...<hpage>...The children born of them, and all the pilgrims after... The Silk has seeded deep into this kingdom’s shells, generations deep...<hpage>No wonder Pharloom’s bugs proved such easy prey for that haunted thread. It had only to seek for itself to reach them.<page>Ho ho! Now you’re seein’ it, bellringer! These poor pilgrims, all born bound to the cruel system of our world, now stricken in its new cursed web.<page>You at least are free from it. And free to shake it all up... if’n that’s your choosing.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_SAVED_BRIDGE_1">Well, well, if it isn’t my very own shadow, the clever little red-cloak! You still following me around, trying to pinch away some of the goodies I sniff out?<hpage>You mistake my intent, ma’am, somewhat ungenerously. The pilgrims of the settlement below were worried by your long absence. It was on their behalf that I tracked you, again.<page>Is that so? What a worrying bunch of busybodies they are! I’m still able to fend for meself!<page>Hmph... and yet, perhaps ‘tis a warm thing that I remain in their thoughts so. I hadn’t expected that. And I can’t deny that you too have done me a good turn once more.<page>That awful flock almost had me, truth be told, and I still have to wonder at your intentions, dear one... but bless you, all the same!</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_RUMMAGE_LIBRARY">Looking for goodies of your own, dear one? You’d do well to avoid the dark vaults near here. They say the keepers inside were jealous hoarders even before the silken curse came down.<hpage>You have more familiarity with the Citadel than most, madam. How long have you spent here, surviving amongst the haunted corridors?<page>Oh, long enough. S’not such a bad lot, all told. The memories of my pilgrimage have all faded now, but a life spent in the Citadel’s golden halls was all I ever wished for.<page>And lo and behold, my humble wish was granted! Certainly, the place might be a bit past its prime, but it’d be churlish of me to complain now, wouldn’t it?</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SHELL_FRAGMENT">Part of an ancient mask, or a fractured shard of someone’s visage? With the full thing, you’d be better able to protect your shell. </entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_MEET_ACT3">What a calamity has befallen our holy Citadel! I ain’t never seen anything like it in my long life.<page>Times like this, we must be sure to help each other. Dig deep, dear one, I’ll be needing a lot of rosaries to survive what’s comin’!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_LV2_MEET">All your work, and look! They keep arrivin’. It’s bugs aplenty up here now. Hapless, weak, but alive they are!<hpage>More scared than weak, they seem to me. It is heartening knowing these few have survived safe for your care.<page>That’s your work, bellringer! Not mine. Ringin’ and helpin’! Hope they recognise your efforts, ‘cause I ain’t providing much, and I ain’t one for fighting if that Choir and their pins ever come callin’.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_REPEAT">Here they limply lay, the castaways and the disillusioned and the used-up.<page>It’s a sorry settlement you’ve summoned, miss bellringer, and a blasted bother for me. Not sure we have anything to offer ‘em... Not even hope.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_SHOP_REPEAT">Stop and share some of your rosaries before you go scurrying off again, dear one. I’m sure to have something that’s to your liking!</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_SPOOLPIECE">Half a spider’s spool. You’d just have to find its match. Them ol’ Weavers built some fine things alright. They’re all long dead, but their craftwork still gleams bright. </entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_ITEM_WALLCLING">A gleaming find for you climbing types. With this in your claw, you’ll be able to stick to walls for as long as you like!</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT_CHURCHKEEPER">Down in the mosslands, still clinging to her failed chapel, my sister’ll part with her power, if asked kind enough.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_ACCEPT_SWAMP_SOUL"><hpage>Grant me your aid, sir. If your trap provides a path to freedom, both for myself and your land’s bugs, I may indeed choose to trigger it.<hpage>What work do you require of me now to see your service made?<page>It’s my family’s strength you’ll need be seeking, bellringer, us three ol’ bugs still alive, spread ‘cross this kingdom, and that sad soul you’re already carryin’ there, the last of my poor cousin, dead and drained in those rotten swamps.<page>Each of my family has power, raw, savage stuff. For you, they’ll give it, if for their fascination at the act, or the thrill of defiance... or because they have no choice at all.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_LACE_DEFEATED"><hpage>Sir, I have opened the way above these halls, and bested the white knight that stood as guardian.<hpage>Child of the monarch, she claimed herself at the end, and her shell suggested it true, a being born purely from Silk woven tight. <hpage>That such a feat is possible... I have seen life woven from Silk before, but tiny, transient... Never like this...<page>Aye, bellringer! You’ve slain a marvel indeed... Well, flawed marvel, at least.<page>One to keep far from she was, least for us mortal sorts. Look of a child and a mind to match, but her’s been up wanderin’ this Citadel longer’n most. Even in its long silence, way ‘fore you came and roused its ire. <page>Might’a seen herself this place’s protector, keepin’ it clean and quiet as she did. Course quiet meant most crossin’ her path found a painful end from her pin.<page>I’d be sayin’ thanks for the slaying, but with all the other husks now awoken and enraged, a bug’s chances ain’t grown by much.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_MERCHANT_MEET">Hello again, dear one. Looks like we both made it up here, safe as told. And what a shock to find you were speaking the truth about this place!<page>A settlement like this in the Citadel, nice and safe, cloistering so many bugs with minds intact! Never seen anything like it, nor even imagined such.<page>Makes trading away all of my nice bits and baubles much easier. After all, I want to take lots and lots of rosaries with me when my strength finally fails!</entry>

<entry name="BALLOW_CONTROL_KEY">Ho, miss! How’s all this then? Lotta dials to be trackin’, but at least the controls seem in good order.<page>From here, I can guide your bell down, best as any bug.<page><hpage>Then you’ve no prior experience with this type of transport?<page>No one does, miss! Them’s who used to dive’re all long dead, or cursed ta half life. An’ there ain’t no bug left alive’s been brave or stupid enough to try... ‘til now, at least.<page>I’ll work it best’s I can. Can’t do much more, I’m afraid. At least the forgings of these docks were built to last. Now we’s only gotta pray they hold for you.<page>Here’s the key that’ll see you inside its metal belly. Pop in there once you’re feelin’ good and ready. In the meantime, I’ll get to seeing things set up here.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_WHITE_FLOWER_REPAIR_UNSEEN"><hpage>Forge Daughter, I have acquired a power that will enable me to end this black madness. Soon I will act to stop the quakes and save this land.<page>Excellent, pointy bug. Your drive, and your vigour, both have proven surprisingly large for one so small.<page>Know we have heard from Ballow, who told of his repair efforts upon the diving bell below. By now, that task is likely completed.<page>If you are hoping to put his work to the test, then we shall wish again on your survival. And if our own service can aid your critical task, know we will continue to provide it gladly.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_DEPLETED_A">Erm, you may notice your prize there is a little light, my lady...<page>Awful truth is, you’ve cleaned us out. We’ve not a single measly rosary left between us. Turns out we were just no match for you!<hpage>It was a game fairly played, sir, though I’ve no wish to see you destitute. Would you like to make another kind of wager, perhaps?</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_PT2">Grfff... So it’s gotten that bad, aye? I guess... If that’s how it is, I’ll be your bug.<page>Meet me below, at the diving bell. We’ll see if I can get you ready for the drop.</entry>
<entry name="DIVING_BELL_POST_INSPECT">Holler when you’re ready, miss. The upgrades are done. That bell’s as ready as it’ll ever be.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_SAUNA_REPEAT">Ahhh... Can you feel it yet? All your troubles dripping away...</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_CANCEL_NOMETAL">The deposits around here, those long-burning rocks. They’re useful to the Citadel, in whatever their shadowy business, but useless if you require tools of us!<page>We need finer material. Rare metal. Pharloom would provide a bounty to the able explorer. Find us some, and we’ll build your violent aids.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_FINAL_END">Ola, ola! Our lady has missed her mark, and so thusly ends our challenge!</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_ABYSS_BLACK">...iss...istake...erwhelm...retrie...a...ssible...</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_DECLINED">My lady, I pray you reconsider! T’would be an honour to see those strong limbs of yours in action, truly!</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_FINAL_POOR">A respectable enough effort, truly. You didn’t earn enough rosaries to make a profit off us, but that should only spur you on to try again!</entry>
<entry name="DOCK_KEY_RECEPTICLE_INSPECT">An old diving bell. Its door is shut tight by an ornate clamp.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_REPAIR_REPEAT">The diving bell’ll be ready again soon, miss. Once this new shield-shell is fitted, it’ll surely withstand the drop!.. Surely!</entry>

<entry name="LADY_BUG_ACCEPTED_3">Ola, ola, time to play! Take these straight pins and strike the target when you see it!</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_TO_BENCH_REPAIRED"><hpage>Sir, I require a moment. Please unlock the bell for me.<page>Aye. Can do, miss. Hail me again when you’re ready to travel.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_SAUNA_MEET">Here to sweat away your sorrows, miss? The steam does wonders for a mind set sullen, or a shell gone stiff.<hpage>I’ve found these lowlands hot enough already, and mine is a shell more resilient than most.<hpage>To challenge that further seems a unique sort of madness.<page>Aye, well, this is Pharloom, miss! Madness is catching. I’d say this here’s the smallest form of it.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_DEPLETED_REPEAT">What an honour it was to play with you, my lady! I hope you’ll think of us whenever you feel those rosaries rattling around in your pockets.</entry>
<entry name="DIVING_BELL_TO_BENCH_INSPECT">Cancel Descent?</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_START_FIRST_MEET_2">There is no choice! Not for us. We cannot leave, not ever. We are a Forge Daughter, fixed to this forge and its service. Ours is a duty lifetime bound.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_DIVING_BELL_REPEAT">If you’re planning passage below, Ballow’s the one to assist you. We must remain by the forge, always.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_START_FIRST_MEET_1">Oh! Pointy bug, why do you bother us at our work? The world cracks and quakes to some grave new calamity, surely you should seek somewhere safer?<hpage>As far as I might flee, I suspect no such place exists, and in any case, I would not see this land’s bugs abandoned to their end.<hpage>What of you? Why do you choose to remain so diligent at your task, given the fell state of your lands?</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_MEET_1">Oh! Small pointy bug, why do you bother us at our work?<hpage>The sound of your craft called me to investigate. What is your duty here? Are you a smith of some kind?</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_ACCEPTED_1">Ola, ola, time to play! Take these straight pins and strike the target when you see it!<page>If you can strike the target fifteen times, the prize is yours!</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_MEET_2">A smith? Hardly so crude! We are Forge Daughter! How can a pointy bug not tell?<page>Ours is the ancient line and honoured role. These docks and lands around are fortunate to have our skills.<hpage>If you are as talented as you suggest, would you lend me your aid? I’ve lacked for my usual tools, and I suspect you could craft fine replacements.<page>Blades and traps, no doubt? We know your type!<hpage>Of sorts, but maybe strange to this land? Some would likely prove fine challenge for your craft.<page>Hmph! Then we’ll construct them. But! You’ll provide the materials, and compensation for our time.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_ACCEPTED_2">Ola, ola, time to play! Take these straight pins and strike the target when you see it!<page>If you can strike the target twenty-five times, the prize is yours!</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_REST">Well, perhaps that’s enough games for now, eh?<page>We’ll need to come up with a much trickier challenge to best you, my lady!</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_REPEAT">This world may not have long, but we shall face its end still delivering our duty.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_SHARD_POUCH_DESC">To maintain one’s tools is a constant task. These shards should be kept close when you travel, that you can repair and replenish as the need arises.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_CONTROL_REPEAT">Pop inside the diving bell once you’re feelin’ good and ready. In the meantime, I’ll get to seeing things set up here.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_ITEM_STING_SHARD_DESC">A vicious stabbing trap? We can build it. Just know, it disturbs us, these devious implements you conceive to kill.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_OFFER">Ola, ola! Welcome, my lady, so glad you found us here! I can see you’re blessed with strong limbs and keen sight.<page>Fond of frolics are you? Keen to test your aim? We’d be right honoured to play a little game with you. A little test of skill we’ve set up.<hpage>I’ve no need to test my skills, sir, nor do I have time for frivolities.<page>Oh, but we’d make it worth your while! A prize awaits you, if you can meet our challenge!<hpage>If you offer a prize, that changes matters. I can meet any challenge if the reward is sufficient. What are the rules of your game?<page>Exceedingly simple, my lady! I’ll provide the pins for throwing, and my associate will provide a target. Hit the target fifteen times and you’ll earn yourself a worthy prize!</entry>
<entry name="KNIGHT_LOCK_INSPECT">A heavy door chained with a simple padlock.</entry>
<entry name="DOCK_KEY_RECEPTICLE_HINT"><hpage>This bell could carry me below, but it will first require a key, and an operator to aid its descent.<hpage>I cannot complete this task alone. Someone upon these docks will have to assist me.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_GENERIC_ACT3">Oi! What’s with all these tremors? This smelt still need shovelling, and the shakes’re only making it harder.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_DIVING_BELL_TALK_FIRST_SHOP_ACT_3"><hpage>Though tied by charge, would you provide me your service, Forge Daughter? I have need of tools that your skills could likely provide.<page>Blades and traps, no doubt? We know your type!<hpage>Of sorts, but maybe strange to this land? Some would likely prove fine challenge for your craft.<page>Hmph! Then we’ll construct them. But! You’ll provide the materials, and compensation for our time.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_TO_TRAVEL_UP"><hpage>Sir, I need to return above. Please ready the bell for me.<page>Aye, miss. Sit on the bench, and let’s get you hauled up.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_FINAL_WIN">Quite a lot of targets struck, and quite a lot of rosaries earned! Our lady never fails to impress us!</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_FAILED">Ola, ola! Have to stop you there. That’s three times now you’ve missed your mark! I’m afraid that makes you the loser of our little game, with all due respect.<page>Fret not though, for we never tire of playing! Step over here, and we can start another game.</entry>
<entry name="DIVING_BELL_TO_BENCH_INSPECT_ASCEND">Cancel Ascent?</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_LAVA_CHARM_DESC">This trinket is our own invention. It wards against the deadly lava and heat around these docks. The workers used to request them of us. Now they’ve lost the mind to care.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_CANCEL_HASMETAL">Farewell, then. If you require our craft, this forge is always hot.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_CONTROL_POST_REPEAT">The new shell-shield’s all bolted on tight, miss. If you’re planning another descent, head down, holler, and I’ll get you where you’re goin’.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_TALK_2"><hpage>The behaviour of your fellow workers, I’ve seen similar... agitation upon the roads. These docks are not alone in the strangeness of their occupants.<page>’Tis odd behaviour to be sure, but not for Ballow and us to know. Ours is busy work, and we keep to ourselves.<page>Whatever the goings on of the world outside, no bother to us, as long as our craft can continue.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_TALK_3"><hpage>How did you come to serve these docks, Forge Daughter?<page>Sent from our Forgehome we were, at request of those holy bugs above.<hpage>The Citadel dwellers? The veiled bugs? They ordered you here?<page>Yes! An age ago that. Such is duty! We Forge Daughters live to hone the craft, and aid the line.<page>By the Citadel’s patronage, and our long duty upon these docks, our Forgehome would swell in holy esteem.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_TALK_1"><hpage>I’d expected this workshop too would contain only combative types, but you seem composed, Forge Daughter.<page>You’ve met the workers? They’re all wound up! They still work at their tasks, in a simple way, but they’re useless for conversation. It’s only ourselves and young Ballow with any sense left.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_CONTROL_POST_MEET_NO_REPAIR_SEEN">Miss! Errr... Ullo... I see you’ve survived... somehow... Thought that last plunge must’a been your end.<hpage>It was not. I survived the fall, and managed a treacherous return.<hpage>For the diving bell’s failure, the risks were clear to me. The fault lies not with you.<page>Aye! As you say! This bell’s old. And time has a way of breaking things even as fine forged as this.<page>And see below, for its failure I’ve been workin’ hard at improving the design! Your last journey ended up being a valuable test... ahem.<hpage>Good. That return path is long closed to me, and your bell is now needed again.<page>Again? We’ll if you’re game enough to try a second time... A shell-shield’s been fitted, and the bell’s like new. Better’n new!<page>If you’re planning another descent, head down, holler, and I’ll get you goin’.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_TO_TRAVEL"><hpage>Sir, I am ready. Please prepare the bell for departure.<page>S’time to take the plunge, aye, miss? Just sit on the bench, and I’ll see you strapped in tight.</entry>
<entry name="DOCK_KEY_RECEPTACLE_INSPECT_DEMO">An old mechanism with a keyhole.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_CONTROL_POST_MEET">It’s done, miss! I’ve fitted the shell-shield. Bell’s like new. Better’n new even!<page>If you’re planning another descent, head down, holler, and I’ll get you goin’.<hpage>Your work is appreciated, sir. Know that, with luck, the threat from below might soon be quelled, and your lands shall rest calm.<page>Well... Good! I’m only really wishin’ to return to the forge, and my regular duties... A little purpose, routine...<page>Frankly, miss, all this action’s more’n a bit overwhelming for bugs like me. I’ll be glad when it’s all over... Providing we survive, of course.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_REPAIR_MEET">Miss! Errr... Ullo... I see you’ve survived... somehow... Thought that drop must’a been your end.<hpage>It was not. I survived the fall, and managed a treacherous return.<hpage>For the diving bell’s failure, the risks were clear to me. The fault lies not with you.<page>Aye! As you say! This bell’s old. And time has a way of breaking things even as fine forged as this.<page>And you can see here, for its failure I’d already been workin’ at improving the design! Ended up being a useful test... ahem.<hpage>Good. That return path is now closed to me, and your bell may still be needed if I choose to descend again.<page>Again? Well, if you’re game enough to try a second time...Once this new shield-shell is fitted, it’ll surely withstand the drop!.. Surely!</entry>

Some would likely prove fine challenge for your craft.<page>Hmph! Then soon, yes! I may accept. But not now! Now there is much work to be done, and we cannot afford to be bothered so.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_DIVING_BELL_TALK_FIRST_MEET">Oh! Small pointy bug, why do you bother this Forge Daughter at their work?<hpage>These black quakes that wrack your lands, I am seeking to see them quelled at their source, below the lakes of flame.<page>You would wish to descend so deep?... It is true these docks possess the means. Alas, we ourselves cannot help. Whether Pharoom’s health or fall, our charge ties us to this forge, always.<page>Ballow there’s the bug to ask, and if our fate is as dire as your action suggests, we are sure he is only needing of some quick convincing.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_REPEAT_DEMO">Return later, pointy bug! Now there is much work to be done, and we cannot afford to be bothered so.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_WHITE_FLOWER"><hpage>Forge Daughter, I have acquired a power that will enable me to end this black madness. Soon I will act to stop the quakes and save this land.<page>Excellent, pointy bug. Your drive, and your vigour, both have proven surprisingly large for one so small.<page>We shall remain here, still. If our service can aid your critical task, know we will continue to provide it gladly.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_SHOP_ REPEAT"><hpage>Stay safe, Forge Daughter. If I require your aid, I shall return.<page>Our wishes go with you, pointy bug. Calm the raging of our world, that our task can continue.</entry>
<entry name="DOCK_DIVING_BELL_CONTROLS_HINT"><hpage>These controls are complex. If I’m to descend within the bell below, I will first require an operator.<hpage>Someone upon these docks will have to assist me.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_TO_TRAVEL_DOWN"><hpage>Sir, I wish to depart. Please ready the bell for travel.<page>Sure thing, miss. Sit on the bench, and I’ll send you down.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_REOFFER">Interested in our little game, my lady?<page>If you can hit the target fifteen times you’ll earn yourself a worthy prize!</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_START">Oh! Pointy bug, you return? Our world cracks and cries from some grave new calamity.<page>Nevertheless, we must remain, fixed to this forge and its service. Ours is a duty lifetime bound.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_GENERIC">If you need something, talk to the boss. I’m busy.</entry>
<entry name="DOCK_DIVING_BELL_CONTROLS">A control panel with various levers and gauges.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_PT1"><hpage>Sir, I have need to head below the lakes of flame.<hpage>There is a diving bell at the base of this structure that seemed fit for the task. I require it opened, and an operator to send it deep.<hpage>As one of few upon these docks with mind still sound, that role must fall to you.<page>Can’t you see I’m busy, miss? Ain’t got time for naught else while the shovelling needs doing.<hpage>Choose to aid me, or all your efforts will soon be wasted. This kingdom crumbles. Its collapse is inevitable. If you wish for your work, and your life to continue, you must help me, now.</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_PT1_BELL_UNSEEN"><hpage>Sir, I have need to head below the lakes of flame. Can you aid me in this task?<hpage><page>Hmmm... Well if you head down below to the very base of the docks, there’s an old diving bell built for just what you’re askin’. <page>Thing is, you can ride it, but it takes an operator stood dockside to send it. I might be capable, but I ain’t got time for naught else while the shovelling still needs doing.<hpage>Choose to aid me, sir, or all your efforts will soon be wasted. This kingdom crumbles. If you wish for your work, and your life to continue, you must help me, now.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_OFFER_PROMPT">Start Challenge?</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_TALK_PRE_POST_MEET">Oi! Who’sat? Whoever’s down there, if you’re feelin’ mad enough to try and travel, best meet me up at the controls, and we can chat.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_POST_ABYSS">Well. Well. Still alive! You have proved yourself made of the hardiest stuff, pointy bug.<page>Ballow did tell, shamefully, of complications with your diving bell, and of your absence upon its retrieval.<page>He had feared you lost to the flame, but we ourself had slight guessed otherwise.<hpage>To return from below proved as difficult a climb as ever I have faced, and yet, in time near, I will need to descend again.<page>Then twice mad you are, bug! Or brave beyond measure. We shall wish on your continued survival, even if you seem intent on ending it.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_REOFFER_2">The frolics haven’t ended, my lady! If you’d like to really test yourself, we should play again!<page>Hit the target twenty-five times and you’ll earn yourself a beautiful necklace of rosaries! What say you?</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_TALK_REPEAT"><hpage>Keep well, Forge Daughter. I shall return if I require your aid.<page>Yes! Or no. Either is fine by us, as long as the craft continues.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_IN_CHALLENGE">Hesitate not, my lady! Take aim and throw true!</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_ITEM_TOOL_KIT_DESC_EXPAND">If you add the implements from this set to your own, the quality of your crafting will increase. You will produce finer, sharper, and deadlier tools... if that is your wish.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_ITEM_TACKS_DESC">Planning to lay a carpet of spikes? These would surely slow your prey. We’d never have considered using such common tools for combat.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_DISQUALIFIED">Ola, ola, ola! Perhaps I neglected to tell you not to cross past those markers? It’s a law of the game, and we all abide by laws here, don’t we?<page>Your actions have disqualified you, my lady, but we harbour no ill will! Step over here and we can begin a new round at once!</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_WIN_1">Ola, ola! That’s it then. Our lady has struck the target fifteen times! A beautiful victory!<page>Hopefully you enjoyed yourself! A little levity is a balm in these troubled times, don’t you think?<hpage>I’d have thought such games best saved for times of peace, but perhaps there is truth in what you say.<hpage>And now that I have bested your challenge, you will produce the prize I have earned?<page>Oh... o-of course! I see you have a tool pouch of your own there. Full to bursting with baubles and trinkets, no doubt!<page>I’ll fit another pocket onto it, so you can carry even more tools and shards with you. A fair prize, wouldn’t you say?</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_REOFFER_3">Ola, ola! We’ve devised a final challenge for you, my lady, if you’re interested.<page>Hit the target as many times as you can without missing. The more targets you hit, the more rosaries you’ll win from us! Care to try?</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_WEAVERSHOT"><hpage>Forge Daughter, within an old Weaver nest I discovered a weapon. Though much damaged by age, I believe your skills could see it restored.<page>Ho. An impressive tool that, and a fine challenge. We can reforge the weapon, if the price fits.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_PURCHASED">A fair exchange made, pointy bug. Now our work calls. Return again if you find need of our trade and talent.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_REPEAT_BALLOW_LEFT">We hope Ballow serves you well, pointy bug. In our long time serving these docks, he’s the finest assistant we’ve found.</entry>
<entry name="DIVING_BELL_TO_TRAVEL_INSPECT_ASCEND">Ascend?</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_ACT_3_WHITE_FLOWER_REPAIR_AND_FORGE_UNSEEN">Well. Well. Still about, pointy bug! You have proved yourself made of the hardiest stuff.<page>Ballow did tell, shamefully, of complications with your diving bell, and of your absence upon its first retrieval.<page>He had feared you lost to the flame, but we ourself had slight guessed otherwise.<hpage>To return from below proved as difficult a climb as ever I have faced, and yet I now need to descend again.<page>Then twice mad you are, bug! Or brave beyond measure.<page>Know we have heard from Ballow, who told of his repair efforts upon the diving bell below.

And if our own service can aid your critical task, know we will continue to provide it gladly.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_FINAL_FAIL">And not a single target was struck... a right shame, that! We can’t reward you with any rosaries, my lady, but we’d love to see you test your aim once more!</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_SILSHOT_DESC">A weapon from a long distant past. We can combine the Weaver components with our own mouldings to repair the tool.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_DAUGHTER_DIVING_BELL_TALK"><hpage>Forge Daughter, these black quakes that now wrack your lands, I am seeking to see them quelled at their source, below the lakes of flame.<page>You wish to descend so deep, pointy bug?... It is true these docks possess a craft capable.<page>Alas, we ourselves cannot help. Whether Pharloom’s health or fall, our charge ties us to this forge, always.<page>Ballow there’s the bug to ask, and if our fate is as dire as your action suggests, we are sure he is only needing of some quick convincing.</entry>
<entry name="FORGE_ITEM_TOOL_KIT_DESC">Crafting by claw alone produces inferior results. With this kit, you can craft finer, sharper, and deadlier tools... if that is your wish.</entry>
<entry name="DIVING_BELL_TO_TRAVEL_INSPECT">Descend?</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_LEFT_IN_CHALLENGE">My lady, you left our game in such a hurry! No doubt some task of great import pulled you away.<page>That’s an instant disqualification, of course. You understand. But we don’t hold it against you, not at all! Care to play again?</entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_TO_BENCH"><hpage>I need a moment, sir. Please unlock the bell that I may exit.<page>Seein’ some sense? Can’t blame ya if you’re thinkin’ on backin’ out. It’s a mad hope that old bell’d even survive the trip. </entry>
<entry name="BALLOW_DIVING_BELL_ABYSS"><hpage>Sir, if you can hear me, there has been an accident during the descent.<hpage>In this broken state, the bell is unfit for travel. Retrieve it if you may, but I shall not return within.<page>...iss...istake...erwhelm...retrie...a...ssible...</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_DEPLETED_B">Oh no... no, not at all. Wouldn’t do us any good, would it? No, it seems like this little frolic of ours is well and truly finished.<page>Oh, but what an honour it was to play with you, my lady! I hope you’ll think of us whenever you feel those rosaries rattling around in your pockets.</entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_WIN_2A">Ola! That’s... that’s twenty-five times the target has been struck!<page>My lady... I thought perhaps you’d have a little more trouble with this round, but you’ve emerged victorious again.<page>I’ll have to speak to my associate. I don’t think he provided you with enough of a challenge, truth be told.<hpage>It was challenge enough. My prize, sir?<page></entry>
<entry name="LADY_BUG_CHALLENGE_WIN_2B">Urk! A prize, of course! My lady must have a prize!<page>Here then... a lovely necklace full with rosaries. I’d been hanging onto this for a while, but you’ve earned it fairly.<page>I just hope you think of me when you wear it, my lady!</entry>

<entry name="TRADERS_QUEST_OFFER"><hpage>The roaches outside, why are they kept in pens? They seem a dangerous creature to cage or tame.<page=S>Us moorbugs gotta eat, don’t we? They’re wild fast breeders, them Muckroaches. Hard shells and tough meat, if you can even crack ‘em open, but options ain’t plentiful so we ain’t choosy.<page=S>Ain’t so bad to eat, once you’re used to it. The guts is the best bit, but them’s a choice cut and we ain’t had it for ages now.<page=L>Har har, life is tough all right! Benj’n here’s wasting away before us, poor wretch!<page=L>Tugs at your emotions, eh missy? How ‘bout you put that poker to good use? Go poach some of them roaches and get us some tasty guts. There’d be fair trade waitin’ for you.</entry>
<entry name="GRUBFARMER_DELIVERY"><hpage>Sir, I have brought a Queen’s Egg, at request of Bellhart’s couriers. It was a hazardous journey, but the creature inside has made it here alive.<page>Sssssss! How sss-ssublime! To think that my dear misss-stress would be the one to deliver the preciousss package! I had feared for the competence of those feeble couriersss...<hpage>It surprises me to know you correspond with them. I must wonder where else you go and who else you speak to after you scurry back up into the darkness...<page>Ssss. My whispersss-ss travel far, misstressss. You need not worry yourssself with my comingsss and goingss-ss. All I do... is in your sssss-service.<page>And now, pleasssse... give her to me... the little queen!</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_TALK_GENERIC_2"><hpage>The beasts outside and their masters alike are all ensnared by this land’s silken affliction. You are lucky bugs to have not succumbed.<page=L>The Haunting? Oh, we’s got that all worked out. Benj’n and me are a right pair of philosophers when we bend our minds to it.<page=L>It’s faith that gets you. It’s all caused by being too devout!<page=S>Yeah! Or maybe not bein’ devout enough!<page=L>Or maybe it’s safest not to think about it at all. Har har!</entry>
<entry name="GRUBFARMER_GROWING_ACT3">While you sss-stalk through the black-ravaged world, morsss-ssels will I grow. For the promiss-sse of what my misss-tress will become... I will toil, alwayssss...</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_TALK_GENERIC_1"><page=S>It’s said the moors used to grow a bounty of fresh food, way back befores that Citadel set us about catchin’ their fallin’ thread.<page=S>Sounds right lovely, eh missy? Always eatin’, never troubled by no grumblin’ belly?<page=L>Har har! Yer like a hatchling, Benj’n! So given to fancies! <page=L>Now breedin’ roaches is what keeps us from starvin’. Dangerous work, and not the finest diet, but we ain’t complainin’.<page=L>Specially as more and more of them keepers are succumbing to the strange sickness. Only means more meat for us. Har!</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_TALK_REPEAT"><page=L>We’re all fine here, miss. Content, like. P’raps it were time you made your way, eh?<page=S>Yeah, be on your way! And, erm, thanks for yer help there.</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_PINS_PROMPT">Buy Steel Spines?</entry>

<entry name="GRUBFARMER_MEET_3_ACT3">Ssss! You have come to claim me, and I am yourssss. I am your humble sss-ssslave!<hpage>I’ve no interest in mastery over you, sir. If my cutting down of those black masses aided you, it was merely by chance. Farewell.<page>Farewell...? No... the sss-strong claim the weak, and the weak must sss-ssserve! I am yoursss, my mistress, and you muss-sst protect me!<page>Sss-ssee what I have built here! Prepared, for the coming of my mistressss. My powerful missssss-tress!<page>While you are away hunting, I will grow you... ssss-something good. But the work takesss time. Return to me sssss-soon, and you may have what I grow...</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_TALK_REFUSE_GIVE"><page=S>Wh... why the delay? You keepin’ them guts for yourself? Here, Crull, she’s goin’ back on her promise!<page=L>Har. Promises is easily broken. But then, so’s a lot of other things. How ‘bout you reconsider yer greed there, missy?</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_PINS_DECLINE"><page=S>Oi! You ain’t got the beads? Or you just not wantin’ to part with ‘em? <page=L>Hardly the time to be a miser, missy. You’re gonna be livin’ sick till you buy these spines from us.</entry>
<entry name="GRUBFARMER_MEET_3">Ssss! You have come to claim me, and I am yourssss. I am your humble sss-ssslave!<hpage>I’ve no interest in mastery over you, sir. If my slaying of these creatures aided you, it was merely by chance. Farewell.<page>Farewell...? No... the sss-strong claim the weak, and the weak must sss-ssserve!

She’s all sick like! Coiled up tight with somethin’ weird. I reckon that operation’s for her herself!<page=S>She’s a sad sight for sure Crull, but sick or not our scrap’s hard-found. If she’s wantin’, we’s gotta be gettin’ paid!<page=L>Ah! ‘Fraid the little one speaks true, missy. You might be ailin’, but we can’t be offerin’ charity. <page=L>We’re stockin’ the spines you need.

<entry name="GRUBFARMER_NEEDOLIN">Sssss! Such sssss-sounds, plucked from the air and caught in your Silk! A marvel, my misss-stress...<hpage>It is a skill that any can learn. You could master this sound yourself, if you cared to.<page>No... a slave must grow morsels for his mistresssss. But the sssound... is so ssssss-soothing...</entry>

We’ll be eatin’ like they do up in the Citadel soon enough!<page=L>And what about you, missy? You be joinin’ us for this exquisite meal?<hpage>I’m afraid not, sirs. I must keep moving, and I fear the taste of such a delicacy is wasted on me.<page=L>I was hopin’ as much. Two can sing, but three’s too many, eh? Har har!<page=L>Still, maybe this tool is enough for you to ‘member us by? A pointed weapon of me own makin’, from when I used to wrangle the Muckroaches meself. I bet you’ll get some good use from it.</entry>

<entry name="GRUBFARM_MIMIC_NOGRUB">Not right. Nothing. Go.</entry>
<entry name="PRINCE_CELL_TALK">Leave me be, traveller. Better I accept this kingdom’s cruelty than rage helpless against it.<page>To waste in a cell, forgotten. ‘Tis no worse a fate than the Haunting that binds Pharloom’s many fragile minds.<hpage>As you wish, prisoner.</entry>

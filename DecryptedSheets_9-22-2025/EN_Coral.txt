<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_POST">How grand! To face an opponent with a bit of energy.<page>You’re a skilled one, clear enough. I hope my training has granted some insight.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_MEET">So rude! To raise a Pinstress from their deep meditation!<page>You carry on with that kind of brash behaviour and you’re likely to be stuck quick through!<hpage>I’m surprised to find a bug of sound mind alive in such an inhospitable place. You are a warrior learned in the blades of this land?<page>Aye! A Pinstress! Your needle there might fit you fair, strange as it is’n all, but it’s the pin that’s the glorious weapon of Pharloom.<page>Given I’m now awake, maybe you’d fancy a little training? Care to test the power of a Pinstress? Might be even this old master could show you a thing or two.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_TALK_ACT_3">It’s a right long time since I’ve felt so vigorous. All those dulled pilgrims were useless for testing my talents.<hpage>Your blade proved an impressive challenge, Pinstress. I’ve travelled the length of this kingdom, yet the strength and skills hidden throughout continue to surprise me.<page>You bear your own strange strengths, needle bug. If only we’d met in less troubled times, just think of all we could have learned from one another!</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_ACCEPTED">Bold choice, needle bug. Let’s get our shells a’shaking!</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_PROMPT">Train with Pinstress?</entry>
<entry name="WORLD_EDGE"><hpage>These sands mark the edge of Pharloom’s territory. I was brought to this land through the caverns beyond.<hpage>Something at this kingdom’s height still hungers for me. Were I to flee now, I would again be pursued.<hpage>Until I find the source of that hunger, and slay it, I will not be free. </entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_NPC_TALK_01">PINSTRESS_NPC_TALK_01</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_STAND_MEET">Back again, needle bug? Surely you’ve more important places calling than these sandy steps?<hpage>I shan’t stay long, Pinstress. Your home and your skills offer a sense of safety rare about these lands.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_QUEST_REPEAT">Find the vassal... pale It. Return them to us... Save us both from the Masters’ wrath.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_MEET_RETURN">Needle bug! With those black quakes, Pharloom’s finale is fast arriving.<page>Raise your blade! Let’s see at least one of us end true to our nature!</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_MEET">Ah ha! Needle bug! Who else would dare wake a Pinstress with such force?!<page>Saw my wish, I’m guessing? Here hopin’ to fulfill it?<hpage>I know what you are seeking, Pinstress... a death duel, an end from battle, not cavern’s collapse.<hpage>I can oblige... to a point... But a greater challenge still awaits me below.<page>Whatever else you’re about, you might be finding it futile now, needle bug. The black quakes... Pharloom’s finale arrives.<page>So let’s stop the yapping, aye! How’s ‘bout we begin? Let’s see at least one of us end true to our nature!</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_REOFFER">Creature, higher... It has been sent... by Masters served... to retrieve Zi’s vassal lost?</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SERVANT_END_1_ACT3">No. No. No... My saviour slain!<page>Why do you do this, cruel slasher? Why must I stay, and serve, so long, long, long?<hpage>That void must not be called, bug. Already it attacks these lands with enough force to end them. To summon it stronger will only hasten that fall.<hpage>For this moment at least, your shell is saved. It was only by wish of your steel companion, and fear of her Masters’ punishment, that I arrived in time.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_DEFEATED_PRE">Gah! Bested fair, and yet you choose to stay the killing blow?<hpage>I can test you, Pinstress, and myself for what’s to come, but I will not cut you down.<hpage>Despite its quakes, Pharloom’s demise is not as certain as it seems. I shall act to change that fate.<hpage>If I succeed at my task, the land that remains will require the watch of strong bugs like you.<page>Well, ain’t you an inspiration! Makin’ me seem a right fool, here thinkin’ only on the end while you’re looking to a future fair...<page>Seems you’ve beaten me twice, needle bug, both my pin’s edge, and my heart’s resolve...</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_ACCEPT"><hpage>Not for your Masters, but by my own will I may aid you, Zi, as long as the path permits.<hpage>Of your vassal, I have met one before, a scurrilous, scheming sort, and well able to remain hidden.<hpage>If your own servant shares similar disposition, they may prove hard to retrieve. Where would you advise I begin my search?<page>Zi has sensed their movement... She knows their places of rest. For pale It... Zi shall mark their chart.<page>Seek the vassal... Retrieve them, or their corpse... either is appropriate... either will aid... to avoid the Masters’ wrath.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_MEET_ACT_3">So rude! To raise a Pinstress from their deep meditation!<page>You carry on with that kind of brash behaviour and you’re likely to be stuck quick through!<hpage>I’m surprised to find any bug still alive in such an inhospitable place. You are a warrior learned in the blades of this land?<page>Aye! A Pinstress! Your needle there might fit you fair, but the pin that’s the glorious weapon of Pharloom, least it was... It’s sure starting to feel like Pharloom doesn’t have long left.<page>Well, given I’m now awake, and time’s suddenly short, maybe you’d fancy a little training? Might be even this old master could show you a thing or two?</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_NPC_REPEAT">PINSTRESS_NPC_REPEAT</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_SIT_TALK_REPEAT">Off with you now, needle bug. I’ve respect for you and your sharp blade, but my hospitality shouldn’t be abused.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_ICECORE_VISITED">Dunno if you’ve heard it, needle bug, but supposedly there’s a gleaming secret hidden at this mountain’s core.<page>Meant to be a marvel, or so my sisters past once told, a giant cavern all of crystal.<hpage>I have visited the core, Pinstress. It was a remarkable site indeed. I only hope that it shall not soon be lost.<page>Course you’ve seen it! Master at the blade and at the seeking. You’ve proven yourself an imposing talent. <page>Well, given you seem done up here, maybe it’s time you get back to your all important business?</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SERVANT_END_2"><page>But the seer knows nothing! Nothing of the pain. All small Sula’s to bear... To watch, watch these lands dying, slow, the bugs suffering, falling, while our shell sustains...<page>The steelhearts feel so little... but we forced to serve, we endure it all. We alone. Why?<hpage>...Others may know that pain, small bug... Or at least something similar.<page>So will you chain me again? Herd me by point of your blade, and knowingly return me to that pain?<hpage>...I will not. I will inform the child of steel of what has transpired here, but I cannot force any bug to return to a task so cruel.<page>Then, then... Sula is free? At least to run? By your mercy, bug, these legs must move, quick, quick and far, far!</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_REPEAT">Zi must watch, record... and wait... Always she is true to her function... Ore-bound... To duty.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_DEFEATED_REPEAT">A mighty battle we had, my friend... Time now you get to your all important business. I’ll be wishing for your success.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_OFFER">...Creature, higher... Its meeting. Zi’s awakening... It is not chance... It has been sent to Zi, yes? By Masters served?... To retrieve her vassal lost?</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_SIT_TALK_01"><hpage>Pinstress, why do you choose to live amidst these storm-swept caverns? Surely there are more hospitable places?<page>Somewhere gentler? Warmer? I’d only go soft! How else is one expected to maintain their wits?<hpage>Then this is not a place of hiding? That Citadel up top seems no friend to the free, or the strong who’d choose to remain apart.<page>...Aye. Well, yes. That too’s a reason, though one that shames me some.<page>Our grand Citadel learnt well from the training of Pinstresses past. Then it went and turned those teachings upon us!<page>Despite our superior skills, our numbers have always been few, and their strength overwhelmed.<page>Of my once revered order, only two of us remain, wormed away in Pharloom’s forgotten corners, and my pin-sibling, she’s lost herself to more peaceable pursuits.</entry>
<entry name="WORLD_EDGE_REPEAT"><hpage>I cannot yet leave this land. Until I slay its source, this kingdom’s hunger for me will never abate.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_DECLINE">Pale It... You would reject the role? Are you not tamed, bound, by Masters?... You would know... obedience is essential.<page>Recall, the fate of those who defy... Even you higher... Especially you higher...<page>...Compression... We have suffered it. We would never wish it upon another.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_DECLINED">Ahh, is your needle too shy to show its edge? What a shame.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_STAND_REPEAT">Even my welcome has limits, needle bug.<page>I’ve become well accustomed to solitude, and it’s unnerving to play host to your strange strength overlong.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_REOFFER">Planning to hang about are you, needle bug?<page>Fancy a little training? Care to test the power of a Pinstress? Might be even this old master could show you a thing or two?</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_REOFFER">Having second thoughts on our bout, needle bug? Good! I’ll not hold back my blade, and I’ll expect the same from you.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_MEET">...Bug... Higher... It has come seeking... Zi is found... She is awoken.<hpage>Greetings, child of steel. I have known your type, in past. From your presence, it is clear this land too has caught the long gaze of your Masters.<page>Masters... Yes... For them, Zi observes... obedient... always...<page>And you... a creature in half... Pale It... Bug It... old... stubborn... alone... You too are observed.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_OFFER_NO_MAP">...Creature, higher... Its meeting, Zi’s awakening... It is not chance... It has been sent, by Masters served?... To retrieve her vassal lost?<page>But no... pale It cannot.. First, a chart is needed. Pale It must acquire one. Only then can Zi provide the marks... Their vassal’s location sensed strong.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_END_1"><hpage>Zi, your vassal is gone, alive, fled beyond these lands.<hpage>I chose to allow their escape, even if your wish may not be granted.<page>The wish? No... pale It... Zi sensed clear your meeting... The rite... The vassal is tarnished. They have touched the dark. By the Masters, they will now be hunted... no matter the distance fled.<hpage>Perhaps, for your vassal, that is preferable? Waste here in servitude or flee free. They made their choice, and proclaimed it clear by their black action.<hpage>Their dark champion is slain, but luck or guile may yet see them survive.<page>Hope!.. Pale It... For a vassal who defies the Masters?... You give Zi a thought, complex...<page>The outcome is different... and Zi must now observe alone... but this may be the better way?<page>Zi shall accept the happening... shall pray the Masters still see her loyal... and Zi too will share the hope... that her vassal lives long unbound.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_DEFEATED_POST">For your talents, needle bug, in blade and strength... and restraint, take this emblem of my order.<page>Hadn’t ever thought another’d be joining our slim ranks, but you’re as deserving a member as’s ever come before.</entry>
<entry name="WORLD_EDGE_ACT3_REPEAT"><hpage>I will not flee. I cannot abandon the kingdom to a collapse of my making.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_REOFFER_NO_MAP">Creature, higher... return when a chart is acquired. A chart is needed, essential, to serve the Masters... to aid Zi.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_DECLINE">Ahh... Shame. Surely battle’d be the better end, no?<page>If not by blade, we’ll just have to accept whatever conclusion this new quaking calamity flings upon our heads.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SERVANT_RITUAL"><hpage>Cease your summoning, fool bug!<hpage>Though you may yearn for freedom, that saviour you hope to call will bring only death.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_TALK">It’s a right long time since I’ve felt so vigorous. All those dulled pilgrims are useless for testing my talents.<hpage>Your blade proved an impressive challenge, Pinstress. The strength and skills hidden about this kingdom continue to surprise me.<page>You bear your own strange strengths, needle bug. More I think than you’d be willing to reveal to me.<page>What, I wonder, are you planning to turn all that power towards?</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SERVANT_END_1">No. No. No... My champion slain!<page>Why do you do this, cruel slasher? Why must I stay, and serve, so long, long, long?<hpage>That void must not be called, bug. Not ever. None can control it, though many have tried. <hpage>Any strength you hoped it offered would fast be proven false.<hpage>Consider yourself fortunate I arrived in time. Your shell is saved, all by wish of your steel companion, and fear of her Masters’ punishment.</entry>
<entry name="WORLD_EDGE_ACT3"><hpage>If I chose to head beyond, I would abandon Pharloom to a collapse of my making.<hpage>While I live, and still possess the strength to act, I will not allow that end to come to pass.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_FINAL_ICECORE">Dunno if you’ve heard it, needle bug, but supposedly there’s a gleaming secret hidden at this mountain’s core.<page>Meant to be a marvel, or so my sisters past once told, a giant cavern all of crystal.<page>If you’re hanging around these heights, and time’s allowing, maybe you’ll get to seeking it?<page>Course you’d first have to find the entrance, but you’ve certainly shown the skills to wriggle up in there, provided you’re so inclined.</entry>
<entry name="STEEL_SENTINEL_END_2"><page>A small gift for you, pale It... for the thought, complex... rock of the home spear... and of Zi’s birth. May it aid your further action in this land.</entry>
<entry name="PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_REPEAT">Off with you now, needle bug! A Pinstress of my substantial talent requires their deep meditation, especially after such a satisfying bout.<hpage>Goodbye, Pinstress. May your blade remain sharp.</entry>

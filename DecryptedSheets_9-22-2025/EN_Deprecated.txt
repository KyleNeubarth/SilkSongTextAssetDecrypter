<entry name="LACE_NEEDOLIN_PLAYED">Oh spider dear! The way you pluck and pound at that crude instrument! What tragedy!<page>(etc.)</entry>
<entry name="QUEST_CORAL_TITLE">Coral Curative</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_ACCEPTED_WISHWALL"><hpage>I saw your request upon Bone Bottom’s wishwall, sir, and have accepted. This is an unusual task... but I am well able to assist.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_MEET_2_ACT3">Death... or something worse, perhaps?<page>It matters not. I have sworn a holy oath, to halt my pilgrimage here until I can understand this affliction. And perhaps through understanding... resist it.</entry>
<entry name="QUEST_CORAL_INV_DESC">Hunt coral-shelled creatures and collect Coral Crust from their bodies.</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST2_REPEAT">I’m eager for the mossblood, assistant. While research needs doing, one must never slack.<hpage>If time permits, sir, I shall acquire your samples for you.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_ACCEPT">Ahh! At last, one as curious as myself! Hurry then! Hunt down lost, wandering pilgrims and wrench the organs from within their shells!<page>Together, we will come to understand. We will learn what haunts the pilgrims...</entry>
<entry name="QUEST_CORAL_WALL_DESC">Our medicines are in short supply and pilgrims often arrive here injured. We can prepare a soothing salve from the ground shells of coral creatures, if we only had some...</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_MEET_2">Hm. Something is haunting the steps of we pilgrims. Tugging at the fringes of our minds, pulling us deep into madness. Leaving nothing but a babbling, grovelling shell.<page>I have halted my own pilgrimage until I can understand this affliction. I won’t allow myself to be overcome, to have my sacred journey end in such a pathetic fashion!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST3_REOFFER">Assistant? Would you still do it? For me? For us? Still... assist? The blood, we need more, further... to understand.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_BELLHART_ARRIVE">We’ve arrived, small spider. Bellhart waits just through that tunnel. From this distance at least it seems safe enough?<page>Perhaps the rumours of its danger were overstated? If you’re needing travel here again, I’m inclined to offer a more reasonable rate.<hpage>Thank you for your service, sir. It may seem safe from here, but I shall keep my guard up nonetheless.</entry>
<entry name="TUNING_FORK_INSPECT">A Weaver tuning mechanism.</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST2_DECLINE">These are crucial studies, assistant! Plasmium’s nature demands understanding.<page>If that doesn’t motivate you, then I worry your mind has dulled.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST3_REPEAT">The muckblood... Please, dear Assistant. Plasmium demands its final challenge.<page>Use the Phial... Strike deep. Suck that foul liquid from the swamp things’ shells... For your forever...</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_PURCHASED">(purchased passage, “get in!” etc)</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_REPEAT">Those bells. Even you’re impressed? The Weavers worked out the way, tapping the resonance of the land itself, and the lingering echoes of song, feeding it up here.<page>It’s all so wonderous, but awakened it’s a blasted nuisance! I’d just about accepted our fate to come, then you had to appear and stir everything up!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_FINAL_DECLINE">Ohh-hhh.... organs... for me...</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_ACCEPT_ACT3">You assent, then... hurry and begin the task. Hunt down lost, wandering pilgrims and take the organs from within their shells.<page>Together, we will come to understand. We will learn what haunts the pilgrims...</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_OFFER">You, who are not a pilgrim. Though your path is not holy, you can still aid me!<page>I wish to understand what haunts these pilgrims, and to do that I must peer into their bodies. Their organs hold the secret of their terrible affliction! You must harvest them for me!</entry>
<entry name="LACE_MEET_GROTTO_1">How sad. A little spider has fallen from its cage. So lost. So weak. Poor little morsel.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_MEET">Gah! Of course it had to be you bellringer! Wriggling your way up here, making all this racket!<page>Now look at what you’ve done! Activated the old bells, the lot of’em and linked’em!<page>There they go, peeling out their sorrowful song, weakening our monarch, even as she wakes.<hpage>You’d still remain cowled before me, sir? Your family is known to me, and no ordinary bug would dare ascend to this cradle. Don’t you think it’s past time you dropped the act of helpless pilgrim?<page>Gah! Curse you, Old One! Permit a bug their small disguise will ya! It’s been a pleasant thing to play the fool! And I weren’t calling for change, even if you insist on bringing it!<hpage>Change was unavoidable, whether I arrived or not. The monarch stirs. My prescence only accelerates the inevitable.<page>So what is it your hopin to achieve, missy? Planning to usurp, aye? Want to become the new queen above us all, to string us up in your own beastly web? Surely it’s the way of Weavers and gods both...</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_MEET_NO_BELLHART">Many thanks for freeing me, small spider. It was a careless move, to blundered into those deadly threads.<hpage>You too look a spider, but these ropes suggest you use no silk in your service?<page>Hoi. No! Don’t mistake. I am arachni, sure, but no Weaver, and the better for it! If I could produce silk I’d be fast seized by the Citadel.<page>To weave... Quite a talent, and I’ll not deny some envy, but my weakness means my hide stays safe.<page>It’s no matter really. I’m a fair talent with my vineropes. Trade me a few rosaries and I’ll take you via routes only I’m able to scale.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST3_COMPLETE">Dear Assistant. Loyal, wonderful... Zango... you have done it. Without you... never could we have, so much... transfigured.<page>I need only consume this last... pure blood... To force the reaction. To become a source. For all... For you... May you be eternal...<page>Take my gift, dear Zango. A symbol... of us... Now.... Always. Reach in, deep. Feel the new form that grows within my shell... It is yours. Yours forever...</entry>
<entry name="LACE_NEEDOLIN_R">(final lace line)</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_STRUNG_MEET">Gah! Traveller, please! This wretched thread has me snared tight. <page>There must be a thick knot up above. Cut me free! </entry>
<entry name="LACE_MEET_GROTTO_3">Delicious! I like you already!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_ACCEPTED_WISHWALL_ACT3"><hpage>I remember now, sir. You left your request upon Bone Bottom’s wishwall, and I accepted it. The nature of this Haunting has changed since then, but I can aid you still.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_REPEAT">With the Needle Phial... The mossblood from the humid caves at Pharloom’s base...<page>We shall force the Plasmium to respond... We need it... You need it... Bring the mossblood...</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_BELLHART_CONFIRM_PROMPT">Travel to Bellhart?</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST3_DECLINE">No? Assistant... But you must. For your forever... you must.</entry>
<entry name="QUEST_CORAL_LOC">Residents of Bellhart</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_MEET_1">You there! Just embarking on your pilgrimage? Tell me, have you been feeling strange? Have you been wandering aimlessly? Does murderous intent suddenly flare up inside you?<hpage>I am no pilgrim sir, but I’ve seen the affliction upon those who wander these roads. Are you investigating the cause?</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST2_COMPLETE_2">And of course, you shall have your recompense. I strung these rosaries together myself, with an exactness and symmetry that none other in this land can match!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_READY">Ahh.... ahhh... the organs?</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_STRUNG_REPEAT">Curses! Traveller! Help me, please!</entry>
<entry name="LACE_NEEDOLIN_1">Look at you, sleeping down there like you’ve only just hatched! Silly little spider.<page>And think! I could have pinned you to the stone to rest forever beside the shells of your ancestors.<hpage>Yet you let me live while I lay defenceless. Your words feign more cruelty than your actions suggest.<hpage>What is your role here, pale child? Do you abide the silk sickness that strikes this land? Do you aid it? Or would you fight against it?<page> What dull questions, little spider! I care nothing for this lands wasting. Only curiosity brought me here, deep under the Kingdom, where the songs are but a whisper.<page> To delight in your pathetic plight is enough! You are a rare treat, entertainment this decaying kingdom rarely grants.</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST2_OFFER">Assistant! If you plan on hanging around, maybe you’d care to take on a smaller task?<hpage>If my path allows, and the compensation is fair, I may consider it. What would you have me do?<page>I seek the blood of the moss creatures, in the humid caves below here. Not to study them. They are unremarkable. It is for the further understanding of Plasmium! We shall unite the substances and see how the plasmium reacts.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_MEET_1_ACT3">Ahh! You... you still have your wits about you! So I am not the only pilgrim left who has resisted the Haunting...<hpage>I am no pilgrim sir, but I am well aware of the affliction that haunts these lands.<hpage>The black thread creeps through these caverns. Lingering here will mean your death.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_REOFFER_ACT3">To understand what haunts the pilgrims I must peer into their bodies. Their organs hold the secret of their terrible affliction. Please... you must harvest them for me!</entry>
<entry name="LACE_REMEET_GROTTO_1">How sad. A little spider has fallen from its cage. So lost, so weak. Poor little morsel.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_CONVO_1">You will find haunted pilgrims wandering the roads of the Marrow and beyond. It seems that even this affliction can not turn these wretches from their pilgrimage.<page>Strike them down wherever you see them and pull the organs from their fallen bodies.<page>And fret not for their suffering! If their mind still remains trapped within their shells, you are surely granting a mercy.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_CONVO_3">The organs. Bring them to me! I must understand this haunting! I must!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_CONVO_2"><hpage>This affliction that plagues the creatures of this land, the haunting as you call it... what do you know of its nature?<page>An unholy sickness, it grips both the living and the dead. Victims lose their senses, attacking any unhaunted creatures they encounter. An ignoble end!<hpage>I see. And what do you believe is the cause?<page>The cause... I feel as though I have almost discerned it. The answer is close, tugging at me as I peer into these lifeless shells...</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST2_ACCEPT">Good! Good! Take again my Needle Phial. Find the moss creatures, any will do, ready the Phial and stick them through to extract their mossblood.<page>This is an easy task and you’ll find little challenge, so the compensation shall only be rosaries. But! Think of the true reward! Understanding! For wonderous Plasmium, every small step is worth taking.</entry>
<entry name="TUNING_FORK_PROMPT">Activate the device?</entry>
<entry name="WEAVER_ABILITY_INTRO"><hpage>Ancestor... What strength remains in your shell, I have need of it.<hpage>May your Silk be bound to my own. And may those who seek to see me chained feel your power full.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_OFFER">Assistant... More may be done... For science, and for you... We shall force the Plasmium’s response...<page>Our great understanding... I can see it there... closer. Would you aid again... Assistant? </entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_REMEET_ACT3_1">Ahh! You still have your wits about you! So I am not the only pilgrim left who has resisted the haunting.<page>But wait... have we not met? Yes, a traveller garbed in red, who is not a pilgrim. How strange that you have returned here, after all this time.<hpage>I travel these lands in search of a means to cleanse them of the black thread. You were once investigating the cause of the haunting, sir... what have you learnt?</entry>
<entry name="LACE_REMEET_GROTTO_3">Delicious! I like you already!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST3_ACCEPT">Goooooood. That’s it Assistant... My dear Assistant.<page>The muckblood... From the swamps beside the sea. Vile, impure... necessary, for great discovery...To become that great discovery.<page>The Needle Phial. Use it. Extract the blood... Bring it. I must ingest that crudest liquid life...</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_CANCEL">(canceled shop menu)</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST2_COMPLETE_1">Excellent! With the mossblood to aid my Plasmium research the speed of discoveries shall greatly increase.<page>You are proving a perfectly adequate assistant! Far better than the last lout, whatever his name was.</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_Q2_REFUSE">Guarding a meagre substance with such jealousy... it does not reflect well on your intellect!</entry>
<entry name="LACE_MEET_GROTTO_2">I can save you little spider. All the trouble you’d face above. All the suffering. It’s so simple.<page>I’ll just skewer you here and now, pluck that flickering life right out of you.<hpage>Your threats are worthless. If you are my foe, stay your voice and raise your blade.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_REOFFER">Our great understanding... I can see it there... closer. Would you aid again... Assistant? </entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_REMEET_ACT3_2">I... I am close to understanding. Yes, achingly close! I can feel the answers to all of my questions slowly slithering out of the darkness.<page>My work continues... I will not leave this place until I understand. I must know what haunts the pilgrims...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_DECLINE">No? Assistant... But you must. For your forever... you must.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_OFFER_ACT3">You are not a sister pilgrim, but your defiance of the black thread’s thrall marks you as holy, surely?<page>To understand what haunts the pilgrims I must peer into their bodies. Their organs hold the secret of their terrible affliction. Please... you must harvest them for me!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_ACCEPT">Ahhh. Wonderful... Together, we can achieve it...<page>The Needle Phial... The mossblood from the humid caves at Pharloom’s base...<page>We need it... You need it... Bring the mossblood...</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_DECLINE_ACT3">You refuse me? The task is unseemly, but you do these poor pilgrims no favour by allowing them to wander mindlessly. You must reconsider!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_MEET">Many thanks for freeing me, small spider. It was a careless move, to blunder into those deadly threads.<hpage>You too look a spider, but these ropes suggest you use no silk in your service?<page>Hoi. No! Don’t mistake.

<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_FINAL"><hpage>Sir, I have delivered what you desired. How fare you?<page>Th... the haunting... I know now. It’s in the thread... I understand... I un-der-stand!<page>Ahhh-aahhhhhhhhhh!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_BELLHART_CONFIRM_DLG">Spider, I can take you to Bellhart, but I warn you, the pilgrim’s speak of bad happenings around that place.<page>Though I’ve not seen it for myself, I’m charging a premium to cover the risk.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_FINAL_ACT3"><hpage>Sir, I have delivered what you desired. How fare you?<page>Th... the haunting... I know now. The black thread... the darkness! There is... nothing!<page>Ahhh-aahhhhhhhhhh!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_COMPLETE">The mossblood... The Plasmium. It demands that foreign, lesser life... It demands violent coercion...<page>You have done so well, Assistant... For your kind efforts, you may relieve this shell of its rosaries. They are heavy, mortal things... On a transcending shell, they will only weigh... </entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_Q2_CANCOMPLETE">Assistant! How goes your latest task? Have you extracted a sufficient amount of mossblood for me?</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST2_REOFFER">Assistant! If you’re wanting more rosaries to fill your pockets, then aid me with the collection of mossblood from the caves below.<hpage></entry>
<entry name="QUEST_CORAL_INV_DESC_READY">Turn in the Coral Crust to the Bellhart wishwall and collect the reward.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_TALK_THREAD">(No longer needed. Remove.)</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_DECLINE">You refuse me as well then, like all the others? You do these wretches no favour by allowing them to wander mindlessly!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_STOMPER_QUEST_REOFFER">I wish to understand what haunts these pilgrims, and to do that I must peer into their bodies. Their organs hold the secret of their terrible affliction! You must harvest them for me!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_SPIDER_MEET_CORAL">Well well. I’ve not seen this old stop in many a beat. You have my thanks for clearing it.<hpage>The coral overgrowth has grown wild. The bug built structures about these climes are subsumed beneath it. <page>I’d heard the coral was always a hard thing to keep under control, even back when the place was well travelled.<page>Now there’s no one left to tend the path, it’s no surprise so few pilgrims find their way through.</entry>
<entry name="LACE_REMEET_GROTTO_2">I can save you little spider. All the trouble you’d face above. All the suffering. Its so simple.<page>I’ll just skewer you here and now, pluck that flickering life right out of you.<hpage>Your threats are worthless. If you are my foe, stay your voice and raise your blade! </entry>

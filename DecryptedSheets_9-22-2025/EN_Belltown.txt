<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_REPEAT_ACT3"><page=S>Miss courier! Pharloom’s bugs are wishing, waiting, sad and scared. The deliverings are needed, now more than more!</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_RELICS_FIRST">But what’s this?! I smell something on you right now! You have a relic for me!</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CURSE_FIX_OFFER">Aha! The spines! Specimen, you have them! Then it is time, indeed! Bzzt! To free you of your wriggling torment, and show my genius clear! </entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_CURSED">Oh my, what a state you’re in! You look like you’re one breath away from keeling over dead!<hpage>I will continue to live, madam, but I am indeed afflicted. A parasite has taken root within my shell... Perhaps you have something that could help me? A medicine?<page>Mmm, not so sure I stock anything like that. You should ask Pavo there. It’s his job to give directions and such, so he may have some useful advice.<page>In the meantime... shopping itself is a type of medicine, isn’t it? You should buy something now. Given your condition, this might be your last chance!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_CURSED_TALK_1"><page=S>Ughhh! What-what is this? Your body is all twisting, creaking! Horrid fiend inside! <hpage>A parasite has lodged deep inside my shell. It has taken some strength of will to keep its thrashing at bay.<page=T>With a shell like such, you cannot be taking no deliverings! Infect the goods you would-would!<hpage>Very well, couriers. If I somehow manage to remove the parasite, I may return to offer aid.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_MEET">What do you want, slave?<hpage>Slave? I am a traveller, stranger, not a slave.<page>Grnk. Exactly what a slave would say. Begone!</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_REPEAT2_ACT3"><hpage>Soon, Pavo, I shall calm the chaos. Please guard these bugs safe till then.<page>Of course, dear resident! Of course! Know all our faith, and our wishes go with you.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_ROSARYSTRING_M_DESC">Loose rosaries will escape your pockets at the worst of times, and I’m a deft claw at stringing them tight! I can string you a whole necklace, safe and stylish.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHORT_QUEST_ACCEPTED"><hpage>I have taken your wish, Tipp. If I find your brother safe, I’ll be sure to send him back this way.<page>My many thanks, miss saving! You are brave-brave. Same as brother! My faith goes all with you!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_REPEAT">Up there, in that Citadel, the fabled oil is waiting. Bestow it upon this fine pinmaster, and your blade shall sing louder yet.<hpage>I will find the oil, pinmaster. Keep your skills sharp.</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CURSE_OFFER">Now now! What’s all this? Infested are you, bzzt?<page>Do you even know who I am? Why, ‘tis the great Yarnaby, genius physician, unfairly outcast, who now towers before you!<hpage>I apologise for intruding upon your work, but if you are the skilled physician you claim, I ask your assistance.<hpage>A parasite has wormed its way inside of me. Its roots twist and pull inside my shell, draining my strength. If you possess the skills and tools, I would see it removed.<page>Bzzt! Well, well! So you’re a special, sickly specimen, are you?! That changes matters, yes. Turns them on their head!<page>Let me see. Hm. Not haunted, indeed. No Silk-sickness. But something strange has certainly clawed its way in!<page>These “roots” that torment you so... I’m not altogether familiar with them, but it matters not!<page>If there’s something nasty inside a shell that must come out, we use great Yarnaby’s Extricator! It’s your only hope, bzzt!<page>...Hmmm, but to crack your stiff shell we’ll first need some extra strength. The healing can be done, yes! But before that my mighty Extricator needs an upgrade!</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_SHARD_POUCH">Travellers should always keep spare shards close by. We Bellharters were once praised for our fine claw-work. An art lost on most modern pilgrims... excepting yourself I’m sure.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_SAVED_3">What a persistent little worm you are. Amuse me then. Why did you cut those poor bugs from their comforting curse?<hpage>There was old power in the creature that guided the thread, and a talent of Silk, now taken, that shall prove useful to me.<hpage>That the town is freed and its service returned is a benefit too. I may ofttimes feel myself apart from these bugs, but even I recoil to see Silk strung in such sickening service.<page>Grnk. To free them was no favour. But the gathering of power... In that goal, we may understand each other some.</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_RELICS">Ahh... I smell something on you. Heavy with the past, you are. You have a relic for me, don’t you?</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_OFFER"><hpage>Your skills are impressive. My needle sings from your care. But I must ask, can the blade be honed further?<page>You seek further sharpening? Further than Plinney does provide? Impertinence! But... Maybe? But... No...<hpage>You hesitate? Then it is possible? Are you incapable? Should I seek others within the kingdom?<page>Wait! Yes. Seek not others, but an oil, fabled and fine. With it the Citadel once brought gleaming edge and point to its pins.<page>Though the Citadel’s pinmasters are long past, some small store of that miraculous elixir may remain within its halls.<page>Were even a meagre drop pilfered, and gifted upon Plinney, your blade could shine brighter still...<page>Just know, dear friend, the veiled bugs would be oh so unkind to the thief who’d claim that fine prize for themself.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_TOOL_POUCH_DESC">You’ve a tool pouch on you? I can add a few pockets so you can carry more tools, and more shards to make’em. My sewing skills are quite renowned in these parts.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_MEET"><page=S>Miss saving! We are together, at last! My brother and myself, both returned to safety’s safe.<hpage>I am pleased you have found one another. If you are planning to venture out again, I would urge you reconsider for the sake of your shells.<page=S>We know it! Muchly-much! We cannot be leaving this home of bells. No more! Heres we will remain, for shells to survive. <page=T>But we instead did plan, together, clever! Yes-yes. Those pilgrims, them that pass, maybes they will help? For small reward as we have?<page=T>Even you, miss saving! Yes-yes! Saving is done. Our wishes now we ask. Now is time for miss courier!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_REOFFER">Lost within that fortress above, the fabled oil of my profession... Such sharpness one could achieve...<page>But, oh! ‘Tis an awful thing. Too cruel, the many stabbing pins you’d face in its seeking.</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_PAINT_POST">We’ve made a good start on the painting, resident! Give us a little more time and your bell’ll be shining like new.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_SNARE">Hnff... So the slave comes seeking?<page>I’ve heard it. Wishing on a world cut free, yes? Along with my nephew up there. Sounds he’s sunk as simple as you.<hpage>Will you not provide your aid, bug? This trap he plans requires power, and I suspect you’re hoarding more than most.<page>Oh no. I’ll give it. Not in the hope you’ll succeed... Bah! In that, there’s slim chance. I give just to see that restless energy unleashed.<page>So much soul, found and formed. Generations of it, all going to waste. Better it’s given a chance to blaze.</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_DOOR_INSPECT">A locked bellhome.<br>Call out?</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_LIFEBLOOD_STATE"><hpage>Madam, my shell has been overcome by a foreign force. Plasmium, it has been called in your land.<hpage>Though the substance provides some regenerative aid, I feel my mind at dangerous risk of being overtaken.<page>Bzzt! Maybe overtaken is good? Better even? Why go thinking yours is a mind so precious?<page>The great Yarnaby treats the sick! Not those that benefit from their afflictions. Enjoy its advantage and leave me in peace!</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_MEET_ACT3">What? What now? What’s all that great racket? What is it?<hpage>Greetings, ma’am. If you are disturbed by the rending of these lands, I fear some blame is mine to bear.<page>Pah. I care not for the miseries and struggles of them outside! None of them have my keen sense, my respect for the past!<page>You seem able, though. Sneaky, too. If you find any fine old stuff, anything with a history to it, bring it here. I’ll take it.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_INPROGRESS_1"><page=S>Keep safe, miss courier! You and your deliverings, fragile both can be!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_INPROGRESS_3"><page=T>Do not wait, miss courier! You hold the deliverings, so nows you must away! A quick-quick bug, you must become yourself.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHORT_GOURMAND_HINT"><hpage>Tipp, I have promised a wish to an old bug of the Citadel, ingredients for a dish to stir a gourmand’s stomach.<hpage>Do you hold in your belongings a Courier’s Rasher? It seems a key element.<page>Courier’s Rasher! Not me, miss savings! Smelly, fatty foods, good for most. Not good for my sensitive stomach!<page>You want-want my brother, Pill! Pill is big. Pill loves rashers! Can prepare them fresh for you, but first, Pill must be found, saved, safe-safe!</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CLOSED_QUEST_END">Bzzt! What now?! Not another bother for the great Yarnaby?<hpage>Madam, I have returned with the spines requested. Allow me to enter, that you may remove this parasite from my shell.</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_PROMPT">Sharpen Needle?</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADED_COMPLETE">That blade! By claw! My finest work by far. Pharloom may ail, but across its morbid dim, your needle will shine bright. </entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_SPA_DESC">Care to refresh yourself in a steaming spa? Given your hard labours, I’m sure your shell would thank you for it.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_LIGHTS_DESC">Twine-strung globes filled with gleamflies. These’ll brighten up even the darkest bell.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_DUSTPENSSLAVE_RETRY"><page=S>Another egg. Another grossy eater queen. Delivery for the big-big creature beyond the roaches. Maybe this one travels safer than last?</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_SLAP_PRE">Specimen, we must! There are secrets to uncover, bzzt! Progress can not be denied!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_CURSED_REPEAT"><page=T>With your shell all a’wriggle, you can’t be taking no deliverings! Infect the goods you would!<hpage>Very well, couriers. If I somehow manage to remove the parasite, I may return to offer aid.</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CURSE_ACCEPT">Bzzt! Bravo! A specimen who sees my brilliance!<page>The task for you is simple. Head over into that tangled mess of cages, on the roads above the moors.<page>Two bugs hide away there, Benjin and Crull. Simple types, woefully ignorant... yet they have been useful in procuring me materials.<page>It’s Steel Spines I need. A full bundle of them, forged hard and sharp. Tougher than I’ve ever had. Tough enough to crack stone! And to pierce your thick shell, bzzt!<hpage>Then prepare your machine for my return, madam. I shall soon return with the spines, for I am eager to see myself freed.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_DESK_NAME">Desk</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_ACCEPT"><hpage>I will find the oil, pinmaster. My needle has seen much use in this cruel kingdom, and I suspect many more battles are due. I will value your further skills upon my blade. <page>It is a dangerous wish you accept of this poor pinmaster. I welly hope this one’s professional desire does not cost you your life.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_CURSED_REPEAT">If you insist on surviving your infestation, seek the one exiled from Bellhart, little Yarnaby. She was chased out, high up into the moors, last I heard.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_REPEAT">I’ll waste no more words on a slave. Begone.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FIXER_RETRY"><page=T>More deliverings for those sad survivors in their cave below. <page=S>Deliver them quick-quick, miss courier! They will help much.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_TWISTED_BUD_HINT">That cry upon you, sister! Those are the sour sobs of a grey and twisted thing.<hpage>You speak of the bud? It is a mysterious thing indeed. In the dank swamps above the moor, I sought towards its plaintive wails, and found it resting there... Waiting, it almost seemed.<hpage>But you speak of its form, without sighting it upon me. Is it a thing familiar to you?... Have you heard these cries before?<page>Aye, yes! Not your own specimen, surely, but way back, other travellers did sometimes carry similar. Odd types they all were. Offerings they’d call the crying things, and towards the core of Shellwood they would trek.<page>Never I did see one again, not the buds nor the bugs that brought the gift...<page>If you’re planning to follow their path, I’ll wish on your safety, but ‘tis an ill omen to hear such sad sounds returned after so long.</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_MEET">What? What, what? Who is it? What’ve you got? What do you want?<hpage>I am just a traveller, one hoping you were not too badly affected by the cursed snare set upon this town.<page>Pah! What binds them outside means nothing to me. None of them have my keen sense, my respect for the past!<page>You seem able, though. Sneaky, too. If you find any fine old stuff, anything with a history to it, bring it here. I’ll take it.</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_COMPLETED">And now! This pinmaster must work! Let the sharpening begin!</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_SAVED_1_ALT">Hff. The noise from above has returned, that pitiful clamour. The threads have been cut.<page>You... It was you who cut them. Do not deny it!<hpage>Why should I deny it, sir? I defeated the cruel creature above the town, and awoke the old bell stilled by Silk. Are you displeased?<page>Displeased! If I breathe, if I live, I am displeased. Only the dead are satisfied.<page>You are a slave, and a nuisance... begone.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_TALK1_ACT3">Resident! What a marvel you are, continuing to dare the wilds and darkness, and returning home to us unscathed.<hpage>I return with hope worth sharing, Pavo. I have seen a way to calm this chaos, one I now work swiftly towards.<hpage>The chance remains slim, but if this town can hold, and my efforts succeed, Pharloom may see a future yet.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_GRAMAPHONE_DESC">The Citadel crafted some marvellous machines, and this looks to be one of its finest! Apparently sent by some creepy slitherer hidden away up there, for sale only to you! </entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_EMPTY">It’s my calling it is, to gather the relics of the past. If you find any fine old stuff, anything with a history to it, bring it here. I’ll take it.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_NOTACCEPTED"><hpage>I can not aid you, couriers. Not now. My own tasks are too pressing to consider taking on your deliveries. <hpage>With luck, some pilgrims may pass with sound mind and strength remaining. They may choose to promise your wishes.<page=T>Then we shall pray they come, miss saving! Our thanks go muchly with you, still.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_SAVED_1">Hff. The noise from above has returned, that pitiful clamour. The threads have been cut.<page>You... It was you who cut them down. Do not deny it!<hpage>Why should I deny it, sir? I severed the thread and defeated the creature guiding the curse upon the town. Are you displeased?<page>Displeased! If I breathe, if I live, I am displeased. Only the dead are satisfied.<page>You are a slave, and a nuisance... begone.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FLEATOPIA"><page=T>We’s heard the word! Many fleas together, settled high in Pharloom, calling out their wants of us!<page=T>Clever grubbers, fleas, but theys too need-need our deliverings. See them served, miss courier! Always goodly-good to gain the thanks of fleas.</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_MEET_ALT"><hpage>Greetings, shopkeeper. I’d ask to trade, but your store seems a little bare.<page>Ahem! Well, yes. Our little town’s seen some dire times, and now my courier’s gone and got themself lost.<page>But don’t worry! I’ve a few small things, still! And if that courier ever makes it safely back, we’ll have plenty more treasures to haggle over.</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_LIFEBLOOD_STATE_REPEAT">Bzzt! Leave me in peace! The great Yarnaby treats the sick! Not those that benefit from their afflictions. Enjoy its advantage and leave me in peace!<hpage>Very well, madam. I did not mean to waste your time.</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_FINISHED">Bonva! It is done, brave warrior. By my expert claw, your strange blade has received some fast-sharp shine. It shall cut cleaner than ever before.<hpage>Your efforts provide great aid, pinmaster. You have my thanks.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_MEET_ACT3"><page=T>Miss courier! What horror here! The caves shake-shake, crying pain of hurt most savage.<page=T>And see all our poor friends below, newly found, crowded inside this home of bells, hearts fast for fear.<page=S>But what-what for you? You are here to help, yes-yes? The deliverings, they are needed now at most! When caves turn dark, the deliverings are essential, more than more.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BROKEN"><page=T>The deliverings! They are broken-broke! Gone and spilled!<page=T>Do not lose hearty-heart, miss courier! This is Pharloom! Danger, deadly. In times as these, is a rarer thing for goods to get to their goings.<page=S>Would you try-try again? For the bugs so much in need of their deliverings?</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_SAVED_2">Those bugs, cowering in their gleaming bells. Grnk. They claim a common calling, to serve the pilgrims as they make their path upwards.<page>Such a crucial role they award themselves, surely worthy of praise!<page>A sweet lie, of course. They, like their predecessors, are simply too weak and fearful to venture any farther. A settlement born from indolence.</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_MEET_ACCEPTEDWISH"><hpage>He would have been wise to do so. If, on my travels, I happen upon the errant bug, I’ll make sure to send him your way.</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_BELLTOWN_MEET_OFFER">By claw! Are you then our saviour in the shell? Standing so calm and cool on entrance to Plinney’s bellhome!<hpage>What clue, sir, tells of my part in your town’s liberation?<page>Why your blade, fierce warrior! Any fine pinmaster would detect the sign of deadly work upon that needle’s edge.<page>T’was a vile curse that struck here. No simple bug, nor basic pin could have granted our release. No!<page>That blade though, so expertly clutched in claw. That could welly have met the task. It was you who cut us free, yes?<hpage>I’ll grant you’ve sharp sight, pinmaster, and your saving is fortuitous. This blade that restored your town would now benefit from your service.<page>Welly, yes! I’ve a busy backlog of pins to tend, but your gracious heroism decrees that unique weapon receives my care this very moment! What’s say I take a look?</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW">More, then! Bring me more relics of the past! Records, seals, idols! Let’s gather up the history of the world and hoard it all here, nice and safe!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_REPEAT"><page=S>Many deliverings still need making, miss courier! We is much needing your help, when you is ready for the giving of it-it!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_UPGRADED">Done, it is! Marvel of Pharloom! See how it gleams, your long, fine blade. Havast! That the pins of our land all once held such shine. So much we have lost...<hpage>This is fine service, pinmaster. It has been a long age since I have seen my needle such. I had not remembered the finesse of its forging.<page>Welly, ho! It is certain! Yours is a blade of finer make than most, one of few that could bear even more sharpening.<page>If ever upon your long road more oil is acquired, seek my service with haste! Who knows what form we could find deeper within your weapon’s sharpened steel!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_NOTACCEPTED_REPEAT"><hpage>For the moment, I can not aid you, couriers. My own tasks are too pressing.<page=T>Then we shall hope you see them soon achieved! If the deliverings are not made, Pharloom’s bugs will suffer muchly-much!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_BELLTOWN_POST_SAVED"><hpage>It is fortune to see you returned, pinmaster. The roads between here and that deep woods’ grave crawl with violent foes. I had concerns for your safety.<page>Brave warrior, my hero! T’was indeed a fearful scramble home, but safe I now am! And a warmly pleasure to see you too, for the world has darkened indeed!<page>In such times, the task for a pinmaster is clear, to polish and sharpen and refine, suchly that the glimmer of your blade may pierce through the encroaching murk!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_DUSTPENSSLAVE"><page=S>We is got requested times a’many for this, a queeny egg of those eaters of Silk. Wish from big, sticky creature, near many roaches caged. Wants it muchly! <hpage>The creature, I have met them, a timid, fawning sort. Nonetheless, their tending of Silkeaters can be a benefit for me.<hpage>If a queen delivered could improve their harvest, I too would gain from the trade.<page=S>Miss courier, and big, sticky creature? Both are like to liking things so grossly-gross? We think yous are muchly strange...</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_FIRST_MEET_ACT3"><page=T>Miss saving! We thought us safe, brothers together at last, but what horror even here! The caves shake-shake, crying pain of hurt most savage.<page=T>And see all our poor friends below, newly found, crowded inside this home of bells, hearts fast for fear.<page=S>But what-what for you? You are here to help, yes-yes? The deliverings, they are needed now at most! Alas, for our shells to survive we cannot now leave this home of bells. No more. Heres we must remain.<page=T>But we instead did plan, together, clever! Yes-yes. Those strong ones, like yourselfs, maybes they will help? For small reward as we have?<page=S>Our savings is done, and the caves turn dark. Now the deliveries are needed, desperate. Now is time for miss courier! </entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_MEET_ALT">What? What, what? Who is it? What’ve you got? What do you want?<hpage>I am just a traveller. May I ask, though, what work occupies you here?<page>What occupies me, you ask? The past! The voices of ages gone by, they speak to me through what is left behind.<page>Those outside, those dreary pilgrims and bell-adorned dullards... none of them have my keen sense, my respect for the past!<page>You seem able, though. Sneaky, too. If you find any fine old stuff, anything with a history to it, bring it here. I’ll take it.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_HOUSE_MID_TALK">Your continued help to Bellhart has not gone unnoticed, miss traveller.<page>In these terrible times, it’s rare enough to see any wish granted. Now to see such care come from a stranger! Why, that’s simply unheard of!<hpage>I have seen the scale of suffering wrought across Pharloom, Pavo. And I will admit, fulfilling these requests may do little to affect the cause... Even still, I have found it a rewarding task.<hpage>To aid another... The small warmth of it, I had almost forgotten.</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_NO_RELICS">It’s my calling it is, to gather the relics of the past. Look at my collection, if you fancy! Look, look!</entry>

<entry name="DOCTOR_CURSE_REPEAT">Off with you! Head over to that tangled mess of cages, in those roads above the moors.<page>Those two bugs, Benjin and Crull, can surely scrounge up what I need. A full bundle of hard, sharp spines!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_4_POST">That blade! By claw! It is done. Sharper than this pinmaster would have believed achievable. Shining pale and clear.<page>Bonva! Stranger, you have granted my wish, and more. Your blade is accomplishment to match those of great pinmasters past.<page>Pharloom may ail, but throughout its morbid dim, your needle will shine bright. </entry>

<entry name="PINSMITH_SAVED_REPEAT"><hpage>Stay alert on your journey home, pinmaster. If you encounter other bugs upon the road, I advise you avoid them as you are able.</entry>

<entry name="GREETER_CURSED">My sickly friend! Pavo can sense that you are ailing, but fret not! For in Bellhart, pilgrims may rest and recuperate until they are fit to travel once more!<hpage>Your hospitality is appreciated, Pavo, but I fear rest alone will not suffice for this illness. A parasite has taken root inside me, one I can not remove through strength alone.<hpage>Tell me, are there any you know who might help me? A healer, or a physician?<page>A physician? Well... we did once have one... A frightening fiend! Callous and crude in her practice. For the health of glorious Bellhart we voted, unanimously, to expel her!<page>I know not where she buzzed away to, and I prefer to keep it that way! But if you really must seek her out, you might start by speaking to the old hermit skulking beneath the Bellway.<page>Yes... that hermit seems mad, but he has a way of accumulating knowledge. He might be able to tell you where that wretched physician is lurking.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_HOUSE_FULL_REPEAT">We are lucky to have you, miss traveller. In Bellhart you are always welcome, you and your big, sharp blade!</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_TALK_1"><hpage>What do you remember of your time caught upon the thread, Pavo?<page>Oh, ahh. It is difficult... Upsetting even to think. Strange, sad memories, not my own, and my own thoughts smothered amidst the tangle.<page>If one could choose to connect themself to something grander, that curse may seem a wonder. For myself, it now seems a horror.</entry>
<entry name="SPINNER_INTRO">Oh! Ohhhh! They shall join... Union upon your thread... A gift, for your waking. A world strung to serve...<hpage>Creature, your claws guide those cursed threads, but you are not their source. What role do you play in this vile affliction?</entry>

<entry name="DOCTOR_CONVO_1">Halfwits, the lot of them! Such grand achievement, wrought by Yarnaby! A bug healed full by my marvellous machine!<page>A few weaklings expire, and they all raise their claws. Is there no place for progress in their tiny minds?!</entry>
<entry name="FISHER_DLG_02">Bellhart’s lost much of its lustre, but we still offer some comfort to the pilgrims who climb this high.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_MEET_ACT3"><page>Dear resident! To see you return alive is such a glimmer of light, even as the dark descends upon us all.<hpage>All these pilgrims gathered here... I had not expected so many to survive. The destruction beyond these bells suggested worse.<page>Indeed! Things should be worse! Would be worse, but for your tall warrior friend, her of those shining rings, who so fortunately chose our town to camp.<page>That brave bug now acts alone to guard our town and those pilgrims who flee for it.<page>For her efforts, our shells have stayed safe, though how long she can remain at that task... I do not dare to consider.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHORT_QUEST_AVAILABLE">My brother, Pill, still out there. Help-help others he must be, taking good-goods all across. I’m is only hope he stay safe-safe, but gone long is Pill. Too long!<page>On the wishwall, I’m placed my wish-wish, that my brother returns to me, and these bells of safety’s safe.<hpage>I shall check the wall, Tipp. If your wish aligns with my journey, I may track him down.</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_MEET_EXPANDED_ALT"><hpage>Greetings, shopkeeper. Given the hardships of the lands beyond these bells, your store seems in remarkable order. <page>Aye, well, we’ve had our tough times too! Of once bustling Bellhart, only a few residents now remain.<page>But things are turned around for old Frey! Ho, yes! The town at least feels briefly at peace, and my courier has returned with fresh goods to trade. <page>Whether pilgrim or traveller, mine is the finest store you’ll have the fortune to visit throughout our blighted lands.</entry>

<entry name="SHOPKEEP_SAVED_COURIER_1"><hpage>Greetings again, shopkeeper. Your shelves are looking better stocked. I see the courier made their way back to you safely.<page>Oh yes, the cheeky little so-and-so came by and dropped his cargo off at last.<page>Poor dear was so shaken by his misadventures, I almost didn’t have the heart to dock his earnings.<page>All’s well now, though! Take a look at the lovely new goods I have available!</entry>
<entry name="SPINNER_INTRO_2">Ohhhh! She is here! The rare birthling! Precious child of Wyrm and Weaver!<page>Spawn of those who dared to flee. She has found her way home... at last.<page>How fine her shell, and Silk, and claw... For you, mother... let me claim her all for you!</entry>

<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_CYLINDER">Ah! That relic you possess! A cylinder of the Citadel’s sacred vault! That there is a mighty find. You will give it, yes?<hpage>I will not, seeker. To extract what knowledge it holds, this cylinder requires a listening device, one you do not possess.<hpage>If it were passed, whatever secrets it contains would remain forever hidden from us both.<page>Pah... If it will not speak to me, I do not want it! Don’t trouble me until you have something worth my taking!</entry>

<entry name="GREETER_MEET_ALT">Welcome, welcome, weary pilgrim! Though glorious Bellhart may be past its finest shine, it still remains the last friendly stop before the Citadel. <page>It is the task of I, fair Pavo, to extend the warmest of welcome to those passing devout, such as your good self!<page>Now! I insist you enjoy our remaining hospitality, if only for a moment. We’ve wares to buy and services to enjoy!<page>Even in our reduced state, you’ll find ours as cosy a stop as can be offered in these ailing lands.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_CURSED_ACT_3">My sickly friend! I can sense that you are ailing. Has the black curse struck even your sturdy shell?<hpage>This illness stems from a different source, Pavo. A parasite has taken root inside me, one I can not remove through strength alone.<hpage>Tell me, are there any you know who might help me? A healer, or a physician?<page>A physician? Well... we did once have one... A frightening fiend! Callous and crude in her practice. For the health of glorious Bellhart we voted, unanimously, to expel her!<page>I know not where she buzzed away to, but the world beyond the bells is full of danger. If you must seek her service, I expect she would not have travelled far...</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_DECLINE">Welly, nay? Certainly you make the safer choice. Better to keep one’s shell intact. </entry>

If, on my journey, I happen upon the errant bug, I’ll make sure to send them your way.<page>Then you’ll have my thanks and more! It’s a rare bug who’d brave the wilds to aid a fellow.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_SPOOL_SEGMENT_DESC">For a spool bearing no Silk, it’s surprisingly heavy. Do you think perhaps it could be a gift left behind by the old creeping ones?</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_CURSED_REPEAT">If you really must find that wretched physician, speak to the old hermit lurking beneath Bellhart. He knows much more than he admits of the world...</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_3_POST">Welly, done! What miracle to work again upon steel so fine. Few pins left in Pharloom could attain such a sheen!<page>You must tell me, traveller, wherever did you come upon so splendid a weapon?<hpage>The blade was a gift, given by a noble tribe of my homeland. They forged the strongest steel, though it was rarely seen beyond their hive.<hpage>That tribe has now long passed, and with them the secrets to their craft.<page>Ahhh. If they are gone, it’s a rarer piece than would be guessed! But what grand luck for this humble pinmaster to have worked with such a weapon!</entry>

<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_MENTION_GOURMAND"><hpage>Couriers, I require a rasher of meat, for an old bug in the Citadel. Can you prepare it for me?<page=T>A bug up-up? Theys knows our finest food? If theys appreciate, we can prepare it most prompt! Miss courier has only to ask.</entry>

<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_REMEET_ACT3">What? What now? What’s all that great racket, what is it?<hpage>Greetings, ma’am. It is only I. If you are disturbed by the rending of these lands, I fear some blame is mine to bear.<page>Blame, is it? Pah. Those who come after us can apportion blame as they see fit.<page>For now, my collection is the only thing that matters! I must protect it!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_MASKMAKER"><page=S>A delivery deadly, dangerous, fiercably cold, for old bug up there that does need it much-much! Serves us all he does, so we serve back.<page=T>And great test for you, miss courier! Most challenging-challenge this. The lacquer to bring is sloshy-slosh.

<entry name="DOCTOR_MAGGOT_REPEAT">Go and rest! Bzzt! Free yourself of your trifling ailment and leave me in peace! The great Yarnaby has no time for petty maladies!<hpage>Very well, madam. I did not mean to waste your time.</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_MEET_EXPANDED"><hpage>Greetings, shopkeeper. It seems you’ve recovered well from that silken affliction.<page>Ah! Well, I’m a clever bug. When that strange thread struck down from above, I shut up tight and huddled in my bellhome.<page>Might’ve been a problem for the others about here, but my store was flush with supplies, so no fear I’d go hungry.<hpage>Your preparedness served you well then, and it seems your store is still well-stocked.<page>Oh yes, even my supplier is back to work, so I have plenty of goods to show you!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_4_PRE_REOFFER">Welly now! You have the oil, traveller! Allow me to bring about a shine bright as none before!</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_ASK_PROMPT_PLURAL">Give Relics?</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CONVO_2">But, hold! There is something more about you... I’ve sliced the shells of countless filthy pilgrims! All those plain, greying innards! Yours are something else entirely!<page>It tickles at my mind, still! Bzzt! What is it of your shell that eludes even my perfect, precise perception?<page>Would you show me, specimen? Go on! Let the great Yarnaby peer at your deeper, darker secrets!<hpage>I’ve no desire to see my shell pried into further, healer. Your service has succeeded, and taken its toll in pain. I hope only that I never again need to seek your aid.</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_FURTHER_REPEAT">If ever upon your long road more oil is acquired, seek my service with haste! Who knows what form we could find deeper within your blade’s sharpened steel!</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CLOSED_ACT3">Gahh! Who keeps making all that racket out there?! Such horrid shaking and screaming. The crucial work is being spoiled! Bzzzt!</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CURSE_ENDED">The operation... a success! The simpletons hiding in that blasted bellvein would shudder into dust if they saw how much I achieve without them!<hpage>Madam... I shan’t lie, that was an ordeal such as I have rarely suffered...<hpage>And yet, the parasite does seem to have been... unbound somewhat. Whatever remnant still lingers in my shell feels calmed, enough for me to claim its power as my own.<hpage>Perhaps this is a fortunate result after all.<page>Of course. Of course! Great Yarnaby has healed you! Shout it through the caverns. Scream it from the great spinning towers!<page>Just make sure they hear you in the so-called ‘civilised’ settlements of this ignorant land!</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW_COMPLETE_REPEAT">A mighty collection of the past, is it not? If only I could hoard all of history here with me!</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_MEET_ACT3">Fellow resident, welcome home! The world may quake and crumble, and threaten its end, but while my shell stays safe my shop stays open.</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CURSE_FIX_ACCEPT">Yes... yes! Bzzt! Finally, a specimen worthy of my mighty Extricator! My beautiful, unfairly-maligned Extricator! Come this way, bzzt...</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_BELLTOWN_MEET_OFFER_ALT">By claw! Who is this bold warrior, standing so calm and cool on entrance to Plinney’s bellhome!<hpage>Merely a traveller, sir, though one whose blade could benefit from your service.<page>Your blade! Of course, fierce warrior! Any fine pinmaster would detect the sign of deadly work upon that needle’s edge.<page>If your weapon sharpened would see our lands that much safer, then honour decrees it receives my care this very moment! What’s say I take a look?<hpage></entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CLOSED_QUEST">Come back with those spines, or not at all! The great Yarnaby’s time is precious, bzzt! I will not be distracted from my work!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_SAVED_TALK">Ahh... how welly romantic t’would’ve been, had the lost pilgrims struck me down beside her grave, to lie together forever as the world crumbles all ‘round...<page>But fortune has claimed otherwise! And perhaps ‘tis best for this humble pinmaster to continue his trade a little longer. These uncertain times will bring much new work, I should think!</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_CURSED">What’s this... twitching inside of you? A slave within a slave! Given over your shell to grow something greater?<hpage>A parasite has made its home within me. It saps my energy, and I can not purge it with strength alone...<page>Grnk. Lie down and die then, for all I care. Allow that wriggling thing its chance at life.<page>Or else... hff. Go seek the one exiled from Bellhart, little Yarnaby. She was chased out, high up into the moors, last I heard.</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW_FIRST">More, then! Bring me more relics of the past! Records, seals, idols! Let’s gather up the history of the world and hoard it all here, nice and safe!<hpage>If I happen upon more curiosities of this kingdom’s past, I may visit again. Until that time, keep yourself safe.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_MASKMAKER_RETRY"><page=T>More for you, miss courier! Lacquer, filled fresh, for the maker on the mount. We have much, so don’t worry for our supply. <page=S>To climb the frozen peak, it is a journey most difficult! Our thanks go full with you that tries again!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_GOURMAND_RETRY"><page=T>More meats for you, miss courier! Best you be delivering it swiftly quick! If left not stored, our rasher’s flavour fast turns foul.</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_CLOSED_REPEAT">Shoo I say! Unless you’ve brought a worthy specimen, with something truly nasty inside them, bzzt! Otherwise, leave the great Yarnaby in peace!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHORT_MEET">Miss saving! Thanks again for you and your big-big blade! I’m is made it back, and grumpy grub-grub got her goods. She seemed happy, even!<page>I’m won’t be travelling out for a while-while methinks. Too many beasties! All about theys are. Even those pilgrims! All now going angry, a bit like old grub-grub.<hpage>This town remains safe for the moment, Tipp. You’re a smart bug to stay within its walls.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_PAINT_DESC">You’ve a good, solid bell up there, though its surface is showing its age. Why not have us paint it fresh? A protective coat and a little flair!</entry>
<entry name="FISHER_DLG_MEET"><hpage>You seem hard at work, good bug. Are you a hunter, of a sort?<page>Of a simple sort, aye. I’m a pondcatcher around these parts. The last remaining, in fact! <page>Us few Bellharters are badly needing for fresh food, so my lone shell’s carrying quite the responsibility.<page>At least Shellwood Pond’s still full of good meat, ‘specially if your aim with a longpin’s as good as mine.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_SNARE_REPEAT">My part’s been given, slave. We’ve no more need to speak.<page>Go and spin your spider’s web. Allow our kingdom’s restless soul its chance to blaze.</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_3_PRE"><hpage>I have more oil, pinmaster. Its acquisition was no small task, but if it aids my blade, those challenges will be well rewarded.<page>Even more oil? What preposterous luck! That unseen gift, in quantity unheard, discovered by a single bug!<page>Would you pass the oil, traveller, and perhaps a few rosaries for the ongoing effort? Allow this pinmaster to again work wonder upon your blade?</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_CRESTSOCKET_BELLHART">An exquisite item, containing a cherished memory. I have an excellent memory myself, but I’m sure you can make good use of it.</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_SLAP_INTRO">Don’t act the fool, specimen! Bzzt! Share more of yourself, that I may gain greater understanding! Learning! What other hope is there to save our blighted, thankless world?! <hpage>I have declined, bug. Whatever you seek, you shall not find it either upon or within my shell.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_HOUSE_FULL_TALK"><page>Miss traveller! Thanks to your valiant contributions, our little town’s starting to feel like its old self again. Homes have been hoisted, and the square shines!<hpage>I have seen the changes myself, Pavo. It is pleasing to hear my contributions have not been in vain. <page>Indeed! Your generosity is a guide for others! We’ve only one thing now sorely missing...<page>Bugs! What is a town without its residents? Age, scarcity, deadly thread... Bellhart is beset by endless ills. Now there’s just us remaining few as you’ve met.<page>In recognition of your noble efforts, and as one small step to solving the problem, I have decreed a grand gift should be given! A bellhome of your very own!<page>A place to reflect. A bed to lay in. It’s hanging up there at the top, beside our good pinmaster. <hpage>I have no plans to settle, Pavo, but for now my task in Pharloom remains, and while it does, a residence may prove useful.<page>Of course! Of course! Your fortitude inspires us all! And if trouble ever descends anew, it surely won’t hurt to have a resident warrior close at claw!</entry>
<entry name="DOCTOR_REPEAT">If you refuse to share your secrets, then distract me no more, specimen! Bzzt!<page>There is still much work ahead for the great Yarnaby! Much thought, much learning!<page>Though the ungrateful world shuns me, still, by my own claws shall it be saved!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_SAVED_THANK_1">Welly’o! What a fearful fright you’ve saved poor Plinney from! Such a delight, at longest last, to see that fine needle dance and sing!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_4_PRE"><hpage>Again, pinmaster, I must ask your skilled service. I bring another gland of oil.<page>Oil, so much! This bug is past surprise! It is time methinks, to see your blade’s work finished! To bring about a shine bright as none before!<page>Welly now! Why wait? Would you have me begin, traveller?</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_SAVED_THANK_2"><hpage>These are deadly roads to wander, pinmaster, especially with the black soaked threads tearing the lands apart.<hpage>Your greatest chance for safety lies in Bellhart, with your fellows. You can protect one another, and perhaps in time rebuild.<page>Oh yes, of course! T’was not Plinney’s wish to abandon his dear bellfriends, but with the world now ending, I had to come and say one last farewell to my sweet Melatolla.<page>I should be returning though, quite rightly. Our town will be needing a pinmaster’s fine work now more than ever!</entry>
<entry name="RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW_COMPLETE">Yes... yes. This is a mighty collection indeed!<page>So many relics safely piled up in here, nice and safe! I’ve done so well to gather it all up!<hpage>If your collection pleases you, some acknowledgement of my own contribution to its growth is not undue.<page>Pah! Is it gratitude you seek?<page>I will allow you to keep viewing my collection. That is gratitude enough for what little you’ve given me!</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_BONETOWNFIXER"><page=S>Once was common, this delivery, for the bugs in their camp beside the bone. Now even this is-is challenge.<page=T>Down there at base, where many pilgrims’ journey start. To ready for their climb, these deliverings will give much value.</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_UPGRADE_3_PRE_REOFFER">Would you pass the oil, traveller, and perhaps a few rosaries for their ongoing effort? Allow this pinmaster to again work wonder upon your blade?</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_TROPHYCAB_DESC">Found some fancy trophies on your travels? Then you’ll be needing these shelves to show them off!</entry>
<entry name="FISHER_DLG_04">Just passing through these lands, are you, miss? I’d warn you not to stray far from Bellhart, but you’ve the look of one who can manage themself.</entry>
<entry name="FISHER_DLG_05">If you’re heading out across the pond, be wary of the other catchers. They’re all long lost to Pharloom’s Haunting.<page>Weak minds, the lotta them. Still, their longpins remain sharp enough.</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_HOUSE">Well, well! Welcome to you, our newest resident! I hope you’re finding your new home to your taste.<hpage>It is a finely forged bell, madam. I am fortunate to have a safe space to rest, even if my stay here may be short.<page>However long you’re with us, I’ve been holding onto some fine goods that’ll cosy up your home. This stuff ain’t for the riff-raff winding through, but a fellow Bellharter deserves the finest! </entry>
<entry name="GREETER_MEET">Welcome, welcome, weary pilgrim! Though glorious Bellhart may be past its finest shine, it still remains the last friendly stop before the Citadel. <page>It is the task of I, fair Pavo, to extend the warmest of welcome to those passing devout, such as your good self!<hpage>Your town seems returned to healthy form, good bug. I had some concern that, upon cutting you free, I’d find only husks.<page>Yes, well, many ahh... err... most of our residents did not fare so well... Still, it’s no good to dwell on dark things! We shall build, and grow, and welcome! As is any good bellbug’s task.</entry>
<entry name="FISHER_DLG_01">You’ve met Frey, miss? She’s usually stocking useful items for travellers such as yourself.</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_PAINT_PRE">The perfect choice! Your bell’s about to be looking the finest in town. We’ll get the work started straight away.</entry>
<entry name="GREETER_FURNISHINGS">If you’re ever finding that bellhome a little bare, make sure to speak with Frey. She’s been known to gather all sorts of fancy furnishings.<page>That stock’s useless for a passing pilgrim, but for a new resident it’s just the stuff to turn a bell into home.</entry>
<entry name="COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_SONGCLAVE"><page=S>Up-up, in the big Citadel, a new place we heard is now claimed safety-safe! Theys too needing our deliverings, we is sure!<page=T>That Citadel.

Please takes them, miss courier!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_COMPLETE_ACCEPT">Tarano! We shall work, now as never. What joy you grant this humble artisan, traveller. Let us seek that shine thought lost within these lands...</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_ALREADY_GOT"><page>Welly, ho! That oil! You have it! That rare substance, hoarded close by the Citadel. Few are the pinmasters of our age that ever chanced to work its wonders.<page>Would you see it, traveller? The finest work of this fair pinmaster and your blade sharper still! Pass me the oil, and we can commence!</entry>

<entry name="DOCTOR_MAGGOT"><hpage>Madam, I am sickly. Maggots of the fetid bogs beyond the moors writhe upon my shell. I would ask your aid in removing them.<page>Maggots! That’s all you bring the great Yarnaby?! My time is precious! Only for the seriously afflicted! The truly, hideously enfeebled. Bzzt!<page>Find a bench, or a bed, or a rock! It’s only rest you need. Settle yourself somewhere, and those maggots will soon wriggle themselves out of your shell. </entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_GENERIC_HOUSE">Welcome, fellow resident! Can I interest you in something special before you’re away again on your travels?</entry>
<entry name="SHOPKEEP_MEET"><hpage>Greetings, shopkeeper. It seems you’ve recovered well from that silken affliction.<page>Ah! Well, I’m a clever bug. When that strange thread struck down from above, I shut up tight and huddled in my bellhome.<page>Might’ve been a problem for the others about here, but my store was flush with supplies, so no fear I’d go hungry.<hpage>Your preparedness served you well then. Although... your store now seems quite bare.<page>Ahem. Yes. I’ll admit, the wait was longer than I’d anticipated, and a bug has to eat...<page>I’ll have more to offer you once my courier turns up. No doubt he’s been avoiding Bellhart since the curse set its sights on us.</entry>
<entry name="SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_LIGHTS_NAME">Gleamlights</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_ENSLAVED_1">You bother me again? Begone, I said!<hpage>I ask only if you know what has happened to the bugs above us. They hang trapped in a vast snare of thread.<page>Hff. Hardly surprising. That there’s the final fate for all in Pharloom. Just come seeking a little sooner for them above.<page>Surely, oh surely, you don’t imagine your own end will be different? All that hunger, and fear, and pride, filling your fragile heart. You too are bound to end ensnared!<page>Grnk! Begone. In Pharloom, only a fool believes themselves free.</entry>
<entry name="BELLHERMIT_ENSLAVED_2">You want to cut them down? Hff. Yes, you look cruel enough.<page>Once the strings are cut, pain will return to them. They will remember fear and longing.<page>What a choice you make for them! Such power you grant yourself!</entry>
<entry name="PINSMITH_QUEST_CANCOMPLETE"><hpage>Pinmaster, I have acquired oil with which my needle may see further sharpening.<page>Bonva! What wonder? What wish? To steal a gift so fine. Few are the pinmasters of our age who ever worked with such a substance.</entry>
